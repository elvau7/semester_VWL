      {id: 1, category: "Axioms of Choice", question: "What does the axiom of completeness assume about a consumer's ability to choose?", answer: "It assumes that for any two bundles A and B, an individual can always rank them as $A \\succeq B$, $B \\succeq A$, or both (indifference)."},
      {id: 1, category: "Axioms of Choice", question: "When is a preference relation defined as \"rational\" in microeconomic theory?", answer: "A preference relation is rational if it satisfies both completeness and transitivity."},
      {id: 1, category: "Axioms of Choice", question: "In preference theory, what is considered the \"primitive\" concept and what are the \"derived\" concepts?", answer: "The weak preference relation ($\\succeq$) is the primitive concept. The strict preference relation ($\\succ$) and the indifference relation ($\\sim$) are derived from it."},

      {id: 2, category: "Continuity and Lexicographic Preferences", question: "Why do lexicographic preferences ($\\succeq_L$) violate the axiom of continuity?", answer: "Because an infinitesimal change in the quantity of the primary good can cause a sudden, massive jump in preference, rather than a smooth transition."},
      {id: 2, category: "Continuity and Lexicographic Preferences", question: "Give a real-world example of a lexicographic ordering.", answer: "Sports tiebreakers: Teams are ranked first by points; only if points are equal is the second criterion (goal difference) considered."},
      {id: 2, category: "Continuity and Lexicographic Preferences", question: "What are two real-world examples where lexicographic preference orderings are commonly applied?", answer: "(1) Sports tiebreakers, where teams are ranked first by points and only then by goal difference. (2) Job candidate rankings, where applicants are first filtered by degree type and then by GPA."},

      {id: 3, category: "Defining the Utility Function", question: "What does it mean for utility to be an \"ordinal\" concept?", answer: "It means the numbers only provide a ranking of bundles; the specific numerical values do not measure how much more one bundle is liked than another."},
      {id: 3, category: "Defining the Utility Function", question: "What is the effect of an order-preserving (monotone) transformation on a utility function?", answer: "It represents the exact same preferences because the ranking of any two bundles remains unchanged."},
      {id: 3, category: "Defining the Utility Function", question: "Beyond physical goods, what other arguments can be included in a utility function to model complex human behavior?", answer: "Utility functions can include peer group consumption (status), personal experiences (habits), leisure, and consumption in different time periods (dynamic models)."},

      {id: 4, category: "Monotonicity and Desirability", question: "How does Strong Monotonicity (SM) differ from Monotonicity (M)?", answer: "SM requires strict preference if at least one good increases and none decrease, whereas M only requires strict preference if all goods in the bundle increase."},
      {id: 4, category: "Monotonicity and Desirability", question: "If preferences satisfy strong monotonicity, can a commodity be a bad or a neuter?", answer: "No. Under SM, more of any good must strictly increase utility, ruling out goods that decrease utility (bads) or have no effect (neuters)."},
      {id: 4, category: "Monotonicity and Desirability", question: "Why does strong monotonicity (SM) specifically rule out the existence of a bad commodity?", answer: "A bad is something where more is strictly worse; however, SM dictates that adding more of any good, holding others constant, must strictly improve preference."},

      {id: 5, category: "Substitutability and Indifference Curves", question: "What is the Marginal Rate of Substitution $MRS_{x,y}$?", answer: "It is the negative slope of the indifference curve, measuring a consumer's willingness to trade $y$ for $x$ while staying at the same utility level."},
      {id: 5, category: "Substitutability and Indifference Curves", question: "Why is it logically impossible for two indifference curves to intersect?", answer: "Intersecting curves would violate transitivity and monotonicity, as a bundle on a higher curve would simultaneously be indifferent to a bundle on a lower curve."},
      {id: 5, category: "Substitutability and Indifference Curves", question: "What does the curvature of an indifference curve indicate about the relationship between two goods?", answer: "The more curved an indifference curve is, the harder it is for the consumer to substitute one good for the other while maintaining the same utility."},

      {id: 6, category: "Convexity and Diminishing MRS", question: "What is the intuition behind the convexity of preferences?", answer: "It represents a love of variety, where consumers prefer a balanced mix of goods over extreme bundles."},
      {id: 6, category: "Convexity and Diminishing MRS", question: "What does a diminishing MRS imply about the shape of the indifference curve?", answer: "It implies the curve is bowed toward the origin, becoming flatter as the quantity of good $x$ increases."},
      {id: 6, category: "Convexity and Diminishing MRS", question: "What is the graphical meaning of the Upper Contour Set (UCS)?", answer: "The UCS is the region on or above, typically to the upper-right of, a specific indifference curve, representing all bundles at least as good as the reference bundle."},

      {id: 7, category: "Cobb-Douglas and Linear Utility", question: "What characterizes the indifference curves of perfect substitutes (linear utility)?", answer: "They are straight lines with a constant slope, and they cut the axes."},
      {id: 7, category: "Cobb-Douglas and Linear Utility", question: "For Cobb-Douglas utility $u(x,y)=x^\\alpha y^\\beta$, what is $MRS_{x,y}$?", answer: "The MRS is $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{y}{x}$."},
      {id: 7, category: "Cobb-Douglas and Linear Utility", question: "Why is it common to normalize the exponents in a Cobb-Douglas utility function so they sum to 1?", answer: "Because utility is ordinal, raising the function to the power $\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta}$ is an order-preserving transformation that simplifies calculations without changing preference rankings."},

      {id: 8, category: "Perfect Complements (Leontief)", question: "What is the shape of indifference curves for Leontief utility $u(x,y)=\\min\\{\\alpha x,\\beta y\\}$?", answer: "They are L-shaped (right-angled)."},
      {id: 8, category: "Perfect Complements (Leontief)", question: "Is Leontief utility strongly monotone?", answer: "No. It only satisfies weak monotonicity because increasing only one good, beyond the required proportion, adds zero utility."},
      {id: 8, category: "Perfect Complements (Leontief)", question: "Using the shoe analogy, why does Leontief utility fail Strong Monotonicity?", answer: "If you have 5 left shoes and 5 right shoes, adding a 6th right shoe adds zero utility; because more of one good does not strictly improve preference, it is not strongly monotone."},

      {id: 9, category: "CES, Homothetic, and Quasilinear", question: "What defines homothetic preferences?", answer: "Preferences where the MRS depends only on the ratio $y/x$, meaning the slope of indifference curves is constant along any ray from the origin."},
      {id: 9, category: "CES, Homothetic, and Quasilinear", question: "What is unique about the indifference curves of quasilinear utility $u(x,y)=x+f(y)$?", answer: "They are vertical translations of each other, and the MRS depends only on the quantity of one good."},
      {id: 9, category: "CES, Homothetic, and Quasilinear", question: "How does the parameter $\\delta$ in a CES utility function determine the substitutability of goods?", answer: "A higher $\\delta$ (closer to 1) means higher substitutability, while a lower $\\delta$ (approaching $-\\infty$) means goods are more complementary."},

      {id: 10, category: "Budget Constraints and Sets", question: "What is the slope of the budget line $p_x x + p_y y = I$?", answer: "The slope is the relative price ratio $-p_x/p_y$."},
      {id: 10, category: "Budget Constraints and Sets", question: "How does the budget set change if income $I$ increases while prices remain constant?", answer: "The budget line shifts parallel outward, expanding the feasible set without changing the slope."},
      {id: 10, category: "Budget Constraints and Sets", question: "What does the slope of the budget line represent in economic terms?", answer: "It represents the relative market price or the rate at which the market allows a consumer to trade one good for another ($-p_x/p_y$)."},

      {id: 11, category: "Optimal Choice and Tangency Conditions", question: "What is the tangency condition for an interior solution in utility maximization?", answer: "The MRS must equal the price ratio: $MRS = p_x/p_y$."},
      {id: 11, category: "Optimal Choice and Tangency Conditions", question: "What is the economic interpretation of the condition $MU_x/p_x = MU_y/p_y$?", answer: "The consumer is getting the same marginal utility per dollar spent on every good (the equimarginal principle)."},
      {id: 11, category: "Optimal Choice and Tangency Conditions", question: "What is the economic interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier ($\\omega$) in utility maximization?", answer: "It represents the marginal utility of income, or how much additional utility the consumer would gain if their budget increased by one euro or dollar."},

      {id: 12, category: "Marshallian Demand and Indirect Utility", question: "What do Marshallian demand functions $x(p,I)$ describe?", answer: "They show the optimal quantities of goods chosen as functions of prices and income."},
      {id: 12, category: "Marshallian Demand and Indirect Utility", question: "What is the Indirect Utility Function $V(p,I)$?", answer: "It identifies the maximum utility achievable given prices and income."},
      {id: 12, category: "Marshallian Demand and Indirect Utility", question: "What is the main difference between a utility function $u(x,y)$ and an indirect utility function $V(p,I)$?", answer: "$u(x,y)$ measures utility from quantities of goods, whereas $V(p,I)$ measures the maximum achievable utility given prices and income."},

      {id: 13, category: "Hicksian Demand", question: "What is the goal of the Expenditure Minimization Problem (EMP)?", answer: "To find the cheapest way to achieve a target utility level $\\bar{u}$."},
      {id: 13, category: "Hicksian Demand", question: "Why is Hicksian demand called compensated demand?", answer: "Because it assumes income is adjusted to keep the consumer at the same utility level as prices change, isolating the substitution effect."},
      {id: 13, category: "Hicksian Demand", question: "Why is Hicksian demand called compensated demand?", answer: "Because it assumes that as prices change, the consumer is compensated with enough income to remain at the exact same utility level."},

      {id: 14, category: "Expenditure Function and Shephard's Lemma", question: "What does the expenditure function $e(p, \\bar{u})$ calculate?", answer: "The minimum total cost required to reach utility $\\bar{u}$ at prices $p$."},
      {id: 14, category: "Expenditure Function and Shephard's Lemma", question: "State Shephard's Lemma.", answer: "The partial derivative of the expenditure function with respect to a good's price equals the Hicksian demand for that good."},
      {id: 14, category: "Expenditure Function and Shephard's Lemma", question: "How does the Expenditure Minimization Problem (EMP) define its opportunity set?", answer: "The opportunity set for the EMP is the Upper Contour Set—the set of all bundles that meet or exceed the target utility level $\\bar{u}$."},

      {id: 15, category: "Duality", question: "In duality theory, how are the Indirect Utility and Expenditure functions related?", answer: "They are mathematical inverses of each other."},
      {id: 15, category: "Duality", question: "What is the result of $V(p, E(p, \\bar{u}))$?", answer: "It equals $\\bar{u}$, the target utility level."},
      {id: 15, category: "Duality", question: "What identity allows you to derive Marshallian demand directly from the indirect utility function?", answer: "Roy's Identity, which involves taking the negative ratio of the partial derivatives of $V$ with respect to price and income."},

      {id: 16, question: "Consider $u(x,y) = \\alpha x + \\beta y$ and $\\hat{u}(x,y) = x^\\alpha y^\\beta$. For which preferences is substitutability higher?", answer: "For linear utility $u = \\alpha x + \\beta y$, the $MRS = \\alpha/\\beta$ is constant — goods are perfect substitutes (the IC is a straight line). For Cobb-Douglas $\\hat{u} = x^\\alpha y^\\beta$, the $MRS = (\\alpha/\\beta)(y/x)$ is diminishing and ICs are curved. Hence substitutability is higher for linear utility: the consumer is always willing to trade goods at a fixed rate.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 17, question: "Show that $MRS_{x,y}$ is independent of the units of measurement of $u(x,y)$, i.e., is the same for $u$ and $f(u)$ when $f'(\\cdot) > 0$.", answer: "For $f(u(x,y))$: $MRS = \\frac{\\partial f/\\partial x}{\\partial f/\\partial y} = \\frac{f'(u) \\cdot u_x}{f'(u) \\cdot u_y} = \\frac{u_x}{u_y}$. The $f'(u) > 0$ cancels, so MRS is the same for $u$ and $f(u)$. This confirms MRS is ordinal and unit-free.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 18, question: "How can we analytically show that $MRS_{x,y}$ is diminishing?", answer: "Compute $MRS = u_x/u_y$ as a function of $x$ (holding utility constant via the IC). Then differentiate MRS with respect to $x$ along the IC (i.e., using the constraint $u(x,y)=\\bar{u}$ to express $y$ as $y(x)$). If $d(MRS)/dx < 0$, MRS is diminishing. Equivalently, check the bordered Hessian condition for strict quasiconcavity.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 19, question: "Define upper contour sets analytically and show them graphically.", answer: "The upper contour set of $(x',y')$ is $UCS(x',y') = \\{(x,y) \\in X : (x,y) \\succeq (x',y')\\} = \\{(x,y) : u(x,y) \\geq u(x',y')\\}$. Graphically, it is the set of all bundles on or above a given indifference curve — the region to the upper-right of the IC (under monotonicity).", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 20, question: "Define convex sets analytically and show them graphically.", answer: "A set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^N$ is convex if for any two points $a, b \\in S$ and any $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, the convex combination $\\lambda a + (1-\\lambda)b \\in S$. Graphically, a convex set is one where the line segment between any two points lies entirely within the set (no 'dents' or holes).", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 21, question: "Suppose $\\succeq$ is convex but not strictly convex. Discuss this case graphically.", answer: "Convex but not strictly convex preferences allow flat segments on indifference curves (linear portions). For example, linear utility $u = \\alpha x + \\beta y$ gives straight-line ICs. Any convex combination of two points on the same IC yields a bundle that is indifferent (not strictly preferred) to the endpoints. Upper contour sets are still convex, but MRS is constant (not strictly diminishing) along the flat segment.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 22, question: "For $u(x,y) = \\sqrt{xy} = x^{1/2}y^{1/2}$: (a) Find IC for $\\bar{u}=10$.", answer: "(a) $x^{1/2}y^{1/2} = 10 \\Rightarrow xy = 100 \\Rightarrow y(x) = 100/x$. The IC is a rectangular hyperbola.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 23, question: "For $u(x,y) = \\sqrt{xy}$: (b) Calculate MRS generally and at $x=5$ (point A) and $x=20$ (point B).", answer: "$MRS_{x,y} = u_x/u_y = \\frac{(1/2)x^{-1/2}y^{1/2}}{(1/2)x^{1/2}y^{-1/2}} = y/x$. On IC $\\bar{u}=10$: $y=100/x$. At $x=5$: $y=20$, $MRS=20/5=4$. At $x=20$: $y=5$, $MRS=5/20=0.25$.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 24, question: "For $u(x,y) = \\sqrt{xy}$: (c) Is MRS diminishing?", answer: "Yes. $MRS = y/x = (100/x)/x = 100/x^2$, which is strictly decreasing in $x$. So MRS is diminishing.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 25, question: "For $u(x,y) = \\sqrt{xy}$: (d) What does diminishing MRS tell us about $\\succeq$?", answer: "Diminishing MRS implies that preferences are strictly convex: the consumer values variety, and balanced bundles are strictly preferred to extreme ones. The upper contour sets are strictly convex sets and $u$ is strictly quasiconcave.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 26, question: "Check convexity for $u(x,y) = x^{1/2}y^{1/2}$.", answer: "$MRS = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}y^{1/2}}{\\frac{1}{2}x^{1/2}y^{-1/2}} = y/x$. As $x$ increases along an IC ($y$ falls), $y/x$ decreases strictly. MRS is strictly diminishing $\\Rightarrow$ preferences are strictly convex.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 27, question: "Check convexity for $u(x,y) = x + xy + y$.", answer: "$u_x = 1 + y$, $u_y = 1 + x$. $MRS = (1+y)/(1+x)$. Along an IC, as $x$ increases, $y$ must fall. Check if MRS falls: $d(MRS)/dx = [(dy/dx)(1+x) - (1+y)] / (1+x)^2$. Along IC, $dy/dx = -MRS = -(1+y)/(1+x)$. Substituting: numerator $= [-(1+y)/(1+x)](1+x) - (1+y) = -(1+y) - (1+y) = -2(1+y) < 0$. So MRS is strictly diminishing $\\Rightarrow$ preferences are strictly convex.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 28, question: "Check convexity for $u(x,y) = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.", answer: "$u_x = x/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, $u_y = y/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. $MRS = x/y$. Along an IC (circle of radius $r$), $y = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$, so $MRS = x/\\sqrt{r^2-x^2}$, which is increasing in $x$. So MRS is increasing, not diminishing $\\Rightarrow$ preferences are NOT convex (they are concave — the consumer prefers extremes).", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 29, question: "For Cobb-Douglas $u(x,y) = x^\\alpha y^\\beta$: Do such utility functions express (strongly) monotone preferences?", answer: "Yes, strongly monotone. $u_x = \\alpha x^{\\alpha-1}y^\\beta > 0$ and $u_y = \\beta x^\\alpha y^{\\beta-1} > 0$ for $x,y > 0$ and $\\alpha,\\beta > 0$. Any increase in either good strictly increases utility.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 30, question: "For Cobb-Douglas: Draw indifference curves. Do they cut the axes?", answer: "ICs are hyperbolic curves $y = (\\bar{u}/x^\\alpha)^{1/\\beta}$, asymptotic to both axes. They do NOT cut the axes (they approach but never touch the $x$- or $y$-axis), since $u=0$ if $x=0$ or $y=0$ when $\\alpha,\\beta>0$.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 31, question: "For Cobb-Douglas: Calculate $MRS_{x,y}$.", answer: "$MRS_{x,y} = u_x/u_y = \\frac{\\alpha x^{\\alpha-1}y^\\beta}{\\beta x^\\alpha y^{\\beta-1}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{y}{x}$.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 32, question: "For Cobb-Douglas: Are preferences (strictly) convex?", answer: "Yes, strictly convex. $MRS = (\\alpha/\\beta)(y/x)$ is strictly diminishing along any IC (as $x$ increases and $y$ falls, $y/x$ decreases). Equivalently, $u$ is strictly quasiconcave.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 33, question: "Why is it allowed to normalize $\\alpha+\\beta=1$ for Cobb-Douglas?", answer: "Because $v(x,y) = u(x,y)^{1/(\\alpha+\\beta)}$ is a monotone increasing transformation of $u$, and therefore represents the same preferences (ordinal utility). After normalization, the exponents sum to 1 but the preference ranking is unchanged.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 34, question: "For Linear Utility $u(x,y) = \\alpha x + \\beta y$: Do such utility functions express (strongly) monotone preferences?", answer: "Yes, monotone (and strongly monotone). $u_x = \\alpha > 0$ and $u_y = \\beta > 0$ for $\\alpha,\\beta > 0$. More of either good strictly increases utility.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 35, question: "For Linear Utility: Draw indifference curves. What do you observe? Do they cut the axes?", answer: "ICs are straight lines with slope $-\\alpha/\\beta$. They do cut the axes: set $y=0 \\Rightarrow x = \\bar{u}/\\alpha$; set $x=0 \\Rightarrow y = \\bar{u}/\\beta$. Goods are perfect substitutes at a constant rate.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 36, question: "For Linear Utility: Calculate $MRS_{x,y}$.", answer: "$MRS_{x,y} = u_x/u_y = \\alpha/\\beta$. It is constant everywhere.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 37, question: "For Linear Utility: Are preferences (strictly) convex?", answer: "Convex but NOT strictly convex. MRS is constant (not strictly diminishing), so ICs are linear. Upper contour sets are convex (half-planes), but mixed bundles are only indifferent to, not strictly preferred over, extreme bundles.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 38, question: "Is it allowed to normalize $\\alpha+\\beta=1$ for linear utility?", answer: "No, unlike Cobb-Douglas, a linear transformation (multiplying by a constant $1/(\\alpha+\\beta)$) does preserve preferences — so technically the normalized version represents the same preferences. However, normalizing $\\alpha+\\beta=1$ changes the MRS value ($\\alpha/\\beta$), which affects the specific rate of substitution. The ranking is preserved but the normalization is somewhat less natural for linear utility since the cardinal values matter less here; it is technically allowed for ordinal purposes.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 39, question: "For Leontief Utility $u(x,y) = \\min\\{\\alpha x, \\beta y\\}$: Do such utility functions express (strongly) monotone preferences?", answer: "Monotone but NOT strongly monotone. Utility increases only when the binding constraint increases. If $\\alpha x < \\beta y$ ($y$ is not the binding input), increasing $y$ alone does not increase utility. So increasing a single good may not increase utility $\\Rightarrow$ not strongly monotone. But increasing all goods strictly ($x \\gg x'$) will eventually increase utility $\\Rightarrow$ satisfies weak monotonicity.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 40, question: "For Leontief Utility: Draw indifference curves. What do you observe?", answer: "ICs are L-shaped (right angles) with the kink at $\\alpha x = \\beta y$, i.e., at $y/x = \\alpha/\\beta$. More of one good beyond the kink adds no utility. Goods are perfect complements.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 41, question: "For Leontief Utility: Calculate $MRS_{x,y}$.", answer: "MRS is not well-defined at the kink. On the horizontal part of the IC (where $\\alpha x < \\beta y$), increasing $x$ adds utility so $MRS \\to \\infty$ (effectively 0 from the $y$-for-$x$ trade perspective). On the vertical part ($\\alpha x > \\beta y$), $MRS = 0$. At the kink, MRS is undefined (any value from 0 to $\\infty$ is consistent).", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 42, question: "For Leontief Utility: Are preferences (strictly) convex?", answer: "Convex but NOT strictly convex. The kink means that any convex combination of two points on the same IC is at least as good (weakly preferred), satisfying convexity. But it is not strictly convex because points on the flat segments of the IC are indifferent to, not strictly preferred over, each other.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 43, question: "For CES Utility: Graphically illustrate cases for further values of $\\delta$.", answer: "$\\delta=1$: straight-line ICs (perfect substitutes). $\\delta\\to 0$: Cobb-Douglas-shaped ICs (smooth, bowed toward origin). $\\delta$ between 0 and 1: ICs intermediate between linear and Cobb-Douglas. $\\delta<0$: ICs more curved than Cobb-Douglas, approaching L-shape. $\\delta\\to-\\infty$: Leontief L-shaped ICs (perfect complements). The more negative $\\delta$, the less substitutable the goods.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 44, question: "Show: as $\\delta\\to 0$, CES $\\to$ Cobb-Douglas.", answer: "Take logs of $U = (\\alpha x^\\delta + \\beta y^\\delta)^{1/\\delta}$. As $\\delta\\to 0$, apply L'Hôpital's rule to $(1/\\delta)\\cdot\\ln(\\alpha x^\\delta + \\beta y^\\delta)$. Differentiating numerator and denominator with respect to $\\delta$ yields $[\\alpha x^\\delta \\ln x + \\beta y^\\delta \\ln y]/(\\alpha x^\\delta + \\beta y^\\delta)$. As $\\delta\\to 0$, $x^\\delta\\to 1$ and $y^\\delta\\to 1$, so this limit $\\to (\\alpha \\ln x + \\beta \\ln y)/(\\alpha+\\beta)$.

      {id: 45, question: "Do all CES utility functions represent homothetic preferences?", answer: "Yes. For CES, $MRS_{x,y} = (\\alpha/\\beta)\\cdot(x/y)^{\\delta-1}$, which depends only on the ratio $y/x$ (equivalently $x/y$), not on the absolute levels of $x$ and $y$. Therefore all CES utility functions represent homothetic preferences.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 46, question: "Does a Cobb-Douglas utility function represent homothetic preferences?", answer: "Yes. $MRS = (\\alpha/\\beta)\\cdot(y/x)$ depends only on the ratio $y/x$. So Cobb-Douglas preferences are homothetic.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 47, question: "Does a linear utility function represent homothetic preferences?", answer: "Yes. $MRS = \\alpha/\\beta$ is constant, which trivially depends only on $y/x$ (or equivalently is independent of levels). Linear preferences are homothetic.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 48, question: "Do all utility functions represent homothetic preferences?", answer: "No. A counterexample is quasilinear utility $u(x,y) = x + \\ln y$. Its $MRS = u_x/u_y = 1/(1/y) = y$, which depends only on $y$, not the ratio $y/x$. So it is non-homothetic: as we move along a ray through the origin (doubling both $x$ and $y$), MRS changes.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},
      {id: 49, question: "For Quasilinear Utility $u(x,y) = x + \\ln y$: Do such utility functions express (strongly) monotone preferences?", answer: "Yes, (strongly) monotone. $u_x = 1 > 0$ and $u_y = 1/y > 0$ for $y > 0$. More of either good strictly increases utility.", category: "Microeconomics Ch3"},

Do they cut the axes?", answer: "ICs are vertical translations of each other: $y(x) = e^{(\\bar{u} - x)}$. They are decreasing and convex, asymptotic to the $x$-axis ($y\\to 0$ as $x\\to\\infty$) but never touching it.

  <h2>Preferences and Fundamental Assumptions</h2>
  <p>The foundation of consumer theory is the <strong>weak preference relation</strong> $\\succeq$, which is treated as a primitive concept from which other choice relations are derived.</p>
  <p><strong>Completeness</strong> means that for any two consumption bundles $A$ and $B$, the consumer can compare them and say either $A \\succeq B$, $B \\succeq A$, or both, in which case the consumer is indifferent.</p>
  <p><strong>Transitivity</strong> requires internal consistency of choice. If a consumer prefers $A$ to $B$ and $B$ to $C$, then the consumer must also prefer $A$ to $C$.</p>
  <p>A preference relation is called <strong>rational</strong> if it satisfies both <strong>completeness</strong> and <strong>transitivity</strong>.</p>
  <p>From the weak preference relation, two additional relations are derived:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strict preference</strong>: $A \\succ B$</li>
    <li><strong>Indifference</strong>: $A \\sim B$</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example: A student comparing universities is complete if they can compare every pair of schools. Their preferences are transitive if, when they prefer Graz to Vienna and Vienna to Salzburg, they must also prefer Graz to Salzburg.</p>

{id: 2, title: "Continuity and Lexicographic Preferences", html: `
  <h2>Preferences and Fundamental Assumptions</h2>
  <p><strong>Continuity</strong> is the assumption that if bundle $A$ is preferred to bundle $B$, then any bundle $A'$ that is sufficiently close to $A$ must also be preferred to $B$.</p>
  <p>This assumption is important because it ensures that small changes in prices or income lead to small changes in behavior rather than sudden jumps, and it supports the existence of utility functions.</p>
  <p>A well-known violation of continuity occurs with <strong>lexicographic preferences</strong> $\\succeq_L$.</p>
  <p>Under lexicographic preferences for two goods $(x_1, x_2)$, the consumer first compares only the amount of $x_1$. Only if the two bundles have the same amount of $x_1$ does the consumer compare $x_2$.</p>
  <p>Example: A safety-obsessed car buyer may rank cars only by safety rating. If Car A is even slightly safer than Car B, Car A is chosen regardless of price or color. Only if safety is identical does price matter. This violates continuity because an infinitesimally small change in safety can completely reverse the ranking.</p>
`},

{id: 3, title: "Defining the Utility Function", html: `
  <h2>The Concept of Utility and its Properties</h2>
  <p>A <strong>utility function</strong> $u(x,y)$ assigns real numbers to consumption bundles such that more preferred bundles receive higher numbers.</p>
  <p>In modern microeconomics, utility is understood as an <strong>ordinal</strong> concept. The numerical value itself does not measure how much more a bundle is preferred; it only indicates the ranking.</p>
  <p>Therefore, any <strong>monotone transformation</strong> of a utility function represents the same preferences, as long as the order of bundles is preserved.</p>
  <p>The arguments of the utility function may include not only physical goods, but also leisure, habits, or the consumption of others when status matters.</p>
  <p>Example: If preferences are represented by $u(x,y)=x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}$, they can also be represented by $v(x,y)=\\alpha\\ln x+\\beta\\ln y$. Since the natural logarithm is strictly increasing, both functions generate the same ranking of bundles.</p>
`},

{id: 4, title: "Monotonicity and Desirability", html: `
  <h2>The Concept of Utility and its Properties</h2>
  <p><strong>Monotonicity</strong> expresses the idea that more of a good thing is preferred to less.</p>
  <p>Under <strong>Strong Monotonicity (SM)</strong>, if bundle $x$ has at least as much of every good as bundle $x'$ and strictly more of at least one good, then $x \\succ x'$.</p>
  <p>This rules out the existence of <strong>bads</strong> and <strong>neuters</strong>. A bad lowers utility, while a neuter has no effect on utility.</p>
  <p><strong>Weak Monotonicity (M)</strong> is less restrictive. It requires only that $x \\succ x'$ if $x$ contains strictly more of every good than $x'$.</p>
  <p>Example: If a consumer is offered the same amount of pizza and one extra soda, strong monotonicity requires that they strictly prefer the new bundle. If the bundle also contains packaging waste, and the consumer is indifferent to the amount of waste, this violates strong monotonicity because the waste acts as a neuter.</p>

{id: 5, title: "Substitutability and Indifference Curves", html: `
  <h2>The Concept of Utility and its Properties</h2>
  <p><strong>Substitutability</strong> describes the trade-offs a consumer is willing to make between goods while maintaining the same level of utility.</p>
  <p>This idea is represented by <strong>indifference curves</strong>, which connect all bundles $(x,y)$ that yield the same utility level $\\bar{u}$.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Marginal Rate of Substitution</strong> $MRS_{x,y}$ is the negative slope of the indifference curve and is given by:</p>
  $$MRS_{x,y} = \\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}$$
  <p>It measures how much of good $y$ the consumer is willing to give up for one more unit of good $x$.</p>
  <p>A key implication of transitivity and monotonicity is that indifference curves for different utility levels <strong>cannot intersect</strong>.</p>
  <p>Example: If a consumer is willing to give up 4 units of juice for 1 extra unit of curry, their MRS is 4. As they get more curry, the willingness to sacrifice juice usually falls, so the indifference curve becomes flatter.</p>

{id: 6, title: "Convexity and Diminishing MRS", html: `
  <h2>The Concept of Utility and its Properties</h2>
  <p><strong>Convexity</strong> captures the idea that consumers usually prefer balanced bundles to extreme ones.</p>
  <p>Preferences are <strong>strictly convex</strong> if any weighted average of two indifferent bundles is strictly preferred to either of the original bundles.</p>
  <p>This is equivalent to saying that the <strong>upper contour set</strong> is convex.</p>
  <p>Analytically, strict convexity implies a <strong>diminishing marginal rate of substitution</strong>. As the quantity of good $x$ increases, the consumer is willing to give up less and less of good $y$ for an additional unit of $x$.</p>
  <p>Example: If bundles $A=(5,20)$ and $B=(20,5)$ are indifferent, a convex consumer prefers the balanced bundle $C=(12.5,12.5)$. For the utility function $u=\\sqrt{xy}$, the MRS falls as $x$ increases, showing diminishing willingness to substitute.</p>

{id: 7, title: "Cobb-Douglas and Linear Utility", html: `
  <h2>Common Mathematical Models of Utility</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Cobb-Douglas utility function</strong> is:</p>
  $$u(x,y)=x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}$$
  <p>It is widely used because it represents smooth, strictly monotone, and strictly convex preferences.</p>
  <p>Its indifference curves are hyperbolic and approach the axes without touching them.</p>
  <p>By contrast, <strong>linear utility</strong> takes the form:</p>
  $$u(x,y)=\\alpha x+\\beta y$$
  <p>This represents <strong>perfect substitutes</strong>. The MRS is constant at $\\alpha/\\beta$, so the consumer is always willing to substitute one good for the other at a fixed rate.</p>
  <p>Example: If Pepsi and Coca-Cola are seen as identical, utility can be written as $u=x+y$. The consumer will always trade one for the other at a 1:1 rate, which gives straight-line indifference curves.</p>

{id: 8, title: "Perfect Complements (Leontief)", html: `
  <h2>Common Mathematical Models of Utility</h2>
  <p><strong>Leontief utility</strong> is written as:</p>
  $$u(x,y)=\\min\\{ax,by\\}$$
  <p>This represents <strong>perfect complements</strong>, meaning goods must be consumed in fixed proportions.</p>
  <p>The indifference curves are <strong>L-shaped</strong> with a kink where $ax=by$.</p>
  <p>At the kink, the MRS is undefined because the slope changes abruptly.</p>
  <p>These preferences are <strong>weakly monotone</strong> but not strongly monotone, because additional units of one good alone do not increase utility once the required proportion has already been met.</p>
  <p>Example: Left and right shoes are perfect complements. If someone has 5 left shoes and 10 right shoes, utility is still only 5. Utility rises only if more left shoes are also added.</p>

{id: 9, title: "Generalizations: CES, Homothetic, and Quasilinear", html: `
  <h2>Common Mathematical Models of Utility</h2>
  <p>A major generalization is the <strong>CES utility function</strong>:</p>
  $$U(x,y)=[\\alpha x^{\\delta}+\\beta y^{\\delta}]^{1/\\delta}$$
  <p>The parameter $\\delta$ determines the degree of substitutability:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>as $\\delta \\to 1$, the function becomes linear,</li>
    <li>as $\\delta \\to 0$, it approaches Cobb-Douglas,</li>
    <li>as $\\delta \\to -\\infty$, it approaches Leontief.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Preferences are <strong>homothetic</strong> if the MRS depends only on the ratio $y/x$. Graphically, indifference curves then have identical slopes along any ray from the origin.</p>
  <p><strong>Quasilinear utility</strong> has the form $u=x+f(y)$. In this case, indifference curves are vertical translations of one another, and the MRS depends only on one good.</p>
  <p>Example: For $u(x,y)=x+\\ln y$, the MRS depends only on $y$. The willingness to trade $y$ for $x$ is the same regardless of how much $x$ the consumer already has.</p>

{id: 10, title: "Budget Constraints and Sets", html: `
  <h2>Utility Maximization (Marshallian Demand)</h2>
  <p>The consumer faces the <strong>budget constraint</strong>:</p>
  $$p_x x + p_y y \\leq I$$
  <p>where $p_x$ and $p_y$ are prices and $I$ is income.</p>
  <p>The <strong>budget line</strong> contains all bundles that exactly exhaust income, while the <strong>budget set</strong> contains all affordable bundles on or below the line.</p>
  <p>The slope of the budget line is the relative price ratio:</p>
  $$-\\frac{p_x}{p_y}$$
  <p>The intercepts are $I/p_x$ on the $x$-axis and $I/p_y$ on the $y$-axis.</p>
  <p>Example: If income is 100, the price of pizza is 10 and the price of soda is 5, then the budget constraint is $10x+5y=100$. The consumer can buy at most 10 pizzas or 20 sodas. The slope is $-2$, so 1 pizza costs 2 sodas in market terms.</p>

{id: 11, title: "Optimal Choice and Tangency Conditions", html: `
  <h2>Utility Maximization (Marshallian Demand)</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Utility Maximization Problem (UMP)</strong> asks which affordable bundle places the consumer on the highest attainable indifference curve.</p>
  <p>For smooth and convex preferences, the optimum is usually an <strong>interior solution</strong> where the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve.</p>
  <p>At this point:</p>
  $$MRS = \\frac{p_x}{p_y}$$
  <p>Equivalently, the first-order condition is:</p>
  $$\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = \\frac{p_x}{p_y}$$
  <p>Example: If a consumer's MRS is 3 but the market price ratio is 2, the consumer values one more pizza more highly than the market does. They should consume more pizza until their MRS falls to 2.</p>

{id: 12, title: "Marshallian Demand and Indirect Utility", html: `
  <h2>Utility Maximization (Marshallian Demand)</h2>
  <p>Solving the utility maximization problem for all prices and income levels yields the <strong>Marshallian demand functions</strong>:</p>
  <p>$x(p_x, p_y, I)$ and $y(p_x, p_y, I)$</p>
  <p>These are also called <strong>uncompensated demand functions</strong>.</p>
  <p>Substituting the optimal bundle back into the utility function gives the <strong>indirect utility function</strong>:</p>
  <p>$V(p_x, p_y, I)$</p>
  <p>This shows the maximum utility achievable at given prices and income.</p>
  <p><strong>Roy's Identity</strong> makes it possible to recover Marshallian demand directly from the indirect utility function.</p>
  <p>Example: For $u=\\sqrt{xy}$, the Marshallian demands are $x=\\frac{I}{2p_x}$ and $y=\\frac{I}{2p_y}$. Substituting these into utility yields the indirect utility function.</p>

{id: 13, title: "Hicksian (Compensated) Demand", html: `
  <h2>Expenditure Minimization and Duality</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Expenditure Minimization Problem (EMP)</strong> is the dual problem to utility maximization.</p>
  <p>Instead of maximizing utility subject to a budget, the consumer minimizes expenditure subject to achieving a target utility level $\\bar{u}$.</p>
  <p>The solution gives the <strong>Hicksian demand functions</strong>:</p>
  <p>$x^c(p_x, p_y, \\bar{u})$ and $y^c(p_x, p_y, \\bar{u})$</p>
  <p>These are called <strong>compensated demands</strong> because income is adjusted to keep utility constant when prices change.</p>
  <p>Therefore, Hicksian demand isolates the <strong>substitution effect</strong>.</p>
  <p>Example: For perfect complements $u=\\min\\{x,4y\\}$, the consumer must consume in fixed proportions. Hicksian demand for $y$ is $y^c=\\bar{u}/4$.</p>

{id: 14, title: "The Expenditure Function and Shephard's Lemma", html: `
  <h2>Expenditure Minimization and Duality</h2>
  <p>The <strong>expenditure function</strong> $E(p_x, p_y, \\bar{u})$ gives the minimum cost required to reach utility level $\\bar{u}$ at given prices.</p>
  <p>It is calculated as total spending on the Hicksian demand bundle:</p>
  $$E = p_x x^c + p_y y^c$$
  <p>A central result is <strong>Shephard's Lemma</strong>, which states that the partial derivative of the expenditure function with respect to a price equals the corresponding Hicksian demand:</p>
  $$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial p_x} = x^c(p, \\bar{u})$$
  <p>Example: If $E(p_x, p_y, \\bar{u})=2\\bar{u}\\sqrt{p_x p_y}$, then differentiating with respect to $p_x$ yields the Hicksian demand for $x$.</p>

{id: 15, title: "Relationships and Inverses: Duality", html: `
  <h2>Expenditure Minimization and Duality</h2>
  <p>The UMP and EMP are connected by the principle of <strong>duality</strong>.</p>
  <p>The <strong>indirect utility function</strong> $V(p,I)$ and the <strong>expenditure function</strong> $E(p,\\bar{u})$ are mathematical inverses of each other.</p>
  <p>This means:</p>
  $$V(p, E(p, \\bar{u})) = \\bar{u}$$
  <p>and</p>
  $$E(p, V(p, I)) = I$$
  <p>Thus, if one knows the expenditure needed to achieve a target utility, plugging that expenditure into the indirect utility function returns the same target utility. Conversely, plugging the maximum achievable utility into the expenditure function returns the original income.</p>
  <p>Example: If $V=\\frac{I}{2\\sqrt{p_x p_y}}$, then solving for $I$ gives the expenditure function $E=2\\bar{u}\\sqrt{p_x p_y}$, confirming the inverse relationship.</p>

   {id: 16, title: "Substitutability: Linear vs. Cobb-Douglas", html: `
    <h2>Substitutability: Linear vs. Cobb-Douglas</h2>
    <p>Substitutability is higher for linear utility $u(x, y) = \\alpha x + \\beta y$.</p>
    <p>The degree of substitutability is captured by the MRS and the curvature of the indifference curves:</p>
    <p><strong>For linear utility:</strong> $MRS_{x,y} = \\alpha/\\beta$, a constant. The consumer is always willing to trade goods at the fixed rate $\\alpha/\\beta$, regardless of how much of each good they currently have. The IC is a straight line — perfectly flat (or straight). Goods are perfect substitutes.</p>
    <p><strong>For Cobb-Douglas utility:</strong> $MRS_{x,y} = (\\alpha/\\beta)(y/x)$, which diminishes as $x$ increases along an IC. The IC is strictly convex (bowed toward the origin). As the consumer has more $x$ relative to $y$, they become less willing to trade $y$ for additional $x$. Substitution becomes progressively harder.</p>
    <p>Economically, the more curved the indifference curve, the harder it is to substitute one good for another. Straight ICs represent the extreme case of perfect substitutability, while the Leontief (L-shaped) IC represents perfect complementarity (no substitutability at all). Cobb-Douglas lies between these extremes.</p>
  `},
  {id: 17, title: "MRS is Independent of Utility Units", html: `
    <h2>MRS is Independent of Utility Units</h2>
    <p>Let $v(x, y) = f(u(x, y))$ where $f$ is a strictly increasing function ($f' > 0$). We compute the MRS for $v$:</p>
    $$MRS^v_{x,y} = \\frac{\\partial v/\\partial x}{\\partial v/\\partial y}$$
    <p>By the chain rule:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = f'(u) \\cdot u_x$</li>
      <li>$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = f'(u) \\cdot u_y$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore:</p>
    $$MRS^v_{x,y} = \\frac{f'(u) \\cdot u_x}{f'(u) \\cdot u_y} = \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = MRS^u_{x,y}$$
    <p>The $f'(u) > 0$ cancels exactly from numerator and denominator. The MRS is unchanged by any strictly increasing transformation of utility.</p>
    <p>This result confirms that the MRS is a purely ordinal concept: it captures the relative marginal valuation of goods (the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute), which depends only on the shape of the indifference curves, not on the specific utility numbers assigned to them.</p>

  {id: 18, title: "Analytically Showing Diminishing MRS", html: `
    <h2>Analytically Showing Diminishing MRS</h2>
    <p>There are two main approaches:</p>
    <h3>Approach 1 — Direct differentiation along the IC</h3>
    <p>Compute $MRS_{x,y} = u_x / u_y$ as a function of $x$, using the constraint $u(x, y) = \\bar{u}$ to express $y$ as a function $y(x)$. Then differentiate MRS with respect to $x$:</p>
    $$\\frac{d(MRS)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\frac{u_x(x, y(x))}{u_y(x, y(x))}\\right]$$
    <p>where $dy/dx = -MRS$ along the IC. If this derivative is negative for all $(x, y)$ on the IC, MRS is diminishing.</p>
    <h3>Approach 2 — Bordered Hessian / Quasiconcavity</h3>
    <p>Preferences are strictly convex (equivalently, MRS is strictly diminishing) if and only if $u$ is strictly quasiconcave. Strict quasiconcavity can be checked via the bordered Hessian $\\bar{H}$:</p>
    <p>MRS is strictly diminishing if and only if $\\det(\\bar{H}) > 0$. This is the standard second-order condition for strict quasiconcavity in two variables.</p>
    <p>In practice, for simple utility functions, the direct approach (substituting $y(x)$ into MRS and differentiating) is most straightforward.</p>
  `},
  {id: 19, title: "Upper Contour Sets", html: `
    <h2>Upper Contour Sets</h2>
    <p>The upper contour set of a bundle $(x', y')$ is the set of all bundles that are at least as good as $(x', y')$:</p>
    $$UCS(x', y') = \\{(x, y) \\in X : (x, y) \\succeq (x', y')\\} = \\{(x, y) \\in X : u(x, y) \\geq u(x', y')\\}$$
    <p>It is the set of all consumption bundles yielding utility at least as high as the reference bundle.</p>
    <p>Graphically (under monotonicity), the UCS of a point $P$ on indifference curve $IC_0$ is the region on or above (and to the upper-right of) the IC passing through $P$. It is the "at-least-as-good-as" region: all bundles that lie on the same IC or on higher ICs.</p>
    <p>The UCS is bounded below by the indifference curve itself (the boundary) and extends outward/upward indefinitely (since more goods mean higher utility under monotonicity).</p>
    <p>The shape of UCS is directly tied to convexity of preferences: preferences are (weakly) convex if and only if all upper contour sets are convex sets.</p>

  {id: 20, title: "Convex Sets", html: `
    <h2>Convex Sets</h2>
    <p>A set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^N$ is called convex if, for any two points $a, b \\in S$ and any scalar $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the convex combination (weighted average) also belongs to $S$:</p>
    $$\\lambda a + (1 - \\lambda)b \\in S \\quad \\text{for all } \\lambda \\in [0, 1]$$
    <p>In words: the entire line segment connecting any two points in $S$ lies within $S$.</p>
    <h3>Graphically in $\\mathbb{R}^2$</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>convex set</strong> has no "dents" or "indentations" — it is a "fat" region. Examples: a disk, a rectangle, a half-plane, a triangle (including interior).</li>
      <li>A <strong>non-convex set</strong> has at least one pair of points whose connecting segment partially lies outside the set. Example: a crescent shape, a star, or a set with a hole.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The relevance to economics: upper contour sets being convex captures the idea that "averages are preferred to extremes." If bundle $A$ and bundle $B$ are both at least as good as some reference bundle $C$, then any convex combination $\\lambda A + (1-\\lambda)B$ is also at least as good as $C$. This is the formal statement of convex preferences.</p>

    <h2>Convex but Not Strictly Convex Preferences</h2>
    <p>Convex (but not strictly convex) preferences allow indifference curves to contain flat (linear) segments.</p>
    <p>Strict convexity requires that any convex combination of two distinct bundles on the same IC is strictly preferred to both. Non-strict convexity only requires that the combination is at least as good (weakly preferred).</p>
    <p>A flat segment on an IC means there exist two distinct bundles $A$ and $B$ with $A \\sim B$, but $\\lambda A + (1-\\lambda)B \\sim A \\sim B$ (the mixture is indifferent to, not strictly better than, the endpoints). The consumer gains nothing from variety over that range.</p>
    <p>The key example is <strong>linear utility</strong> $u(x, y) = \\alpha x + \\beta y$: the entire IC is a straight line. Every mixture of two bundles on the same IC yields the same utility. Upper contour sets are half-planes (convex), but $MRS = \\alpha/\\beta$ is constant, not strictly diminishing.</p>
    <p><strong>Leontief utility</strong> offers another illustration: along the flat portions of the L-shaped IC (horizontal and vertical arms), the MRS is constant (0 or $\\infty$), so preferences are convex but not strictly convex there.</p>
    <p>In summary: convex but not strictly convex preferences permit perfect substitute-like behavior over some ranges, while still satisfying the weaker convexity requirement.</p>

    <p>As $x$ increases along an IC (with $y$ falling to keep $u$ constant), the ratio $y/x$ decreases strictly, so $MRS = (\\alpha/\\beta)(y/x)$ decreases strictly.</p>

    <p>Because the transformation $v(x,y) = u(x,y)^{1/(\\alpha+\\beta)}$ is a strictly increasing monotone transformation, and therefore $v$ represents the same preferences as $u$.</p>
    <p>Specifically:</p>
    $$v(x,y) = [x^{\\alpha} y^{\\beta}]^{1/(\\alpha+\\beta)} = x^{\\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)} \\cdot y^{\\beta/(\\alpha+\\beta)}$$
    <p>Let $\\alpha' = \\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)$ and $\\beta' = \\beta/(\\alpha+\\beta)$. Then $\\alpha' + \\beta' = (\\alpha+\\beta)/(\\alpha+\\beta) = 1$. So $v$ has the same Cobb-Douglas form with exponents summing to 1.</p>
    <p>Since $f(t) = t^{1/(\\alpha+\\beta)}$ is a strictly increasing function for $t > 0$ and $1/(\\alpha+\\beta) > 0$, the transformation preserves the preference ordering:</p>
    $$u(x,y) \\geq u(x',y') \\iff v(x,y) \\geq v(x',y')$$
    <p>Therefore $v$ represents the same $\\succeq$ as $u$. The normalization is purely cosmetic — it simplifies expressions (e.g., expenditure shares equal $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta'$) without changing any economic predictions about demand, MRS, or comparative statics.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Upper contour sets are half-planes (convex sets), so convexity holds.</li>
      <li>However, for any two bundles $A$ and $B$ on the same IC, their convex combination $\\lambda A + (1-\\lambda)B$ also lies on the same IC (indifferent, not strictly preferred). So the strict convexity condition "mixtures are strictly preferred to extremes" fails.</li>

    <p><em>Is normalization $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$ allowed?</em> Unlike Cobb-Douglas (where multiplying by $1/(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is a power transformation), for linear utility multiplying by $1/(\\alpha+\\beta)$ is also a strictly increasing linear transformation (scaling), which preserves preferences.

    <p>However, normalizing $\\alpha+\\beta=1$ changes the MRS value ($\\alpha/\\beta$), which affects the specific rate of substitution. The ranking is preserved but the normalization is somewhat less natural for linear utility since the cardinal values matter less here; it is technically allowed for ordinal purposes.</p>
    <p>The key distinction: for Cobb-Douglas, the normalization is a <em>power</em> transformation (non-linear), while for linear utility it is a <em>linear</em> scaling. Both are strictly increasing and therefore order-preserving.

    <p>Geometrically: along any ray through the origin (where $y/x$ is fixed), the MRS is $\\alpha/\\beta$, same as everywhere else. The indifference curves are parallel straight lines with the same slope $-\\alpha/\\beta$ everywhere.</p>
    <p>As a special case of homotheticity: the income expansion path is any mix of goods achieving the optimal MRS. Since MRS $= \\alpha/\\beta$ is fixed, the consumer is indifferent among all proportions (corner solutions or any mix), but the demand for each good is linear in income. This income-linearity of demand is a general property of homothetic preferences.</p>

  {id: 48, title: "Not All Utility Functions are Homothetic", html: `
    <h2>Not All Utility Functions are Homothetic</h2>
    <p>No. Not all utility functions represent homothetic preferences. A clear counterexample is quasilinear utility.</p>
    <p>Consider $u(x, y) = x + \\ln y$:</p>
    $$MRS_{x,y} = \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = \\frac{1}{1/y} = y$$
    <p>The MRS depends only on $y$, not on the ratio $y/x$. This means that along a ray through the origin (where $y/x = k$ is constant, so $y = kx$), as $x$ and $y$ scale up together: MRS $= y = kx$, which <strong>increases</strong> as we move further along the ray. The MRS is not constant along rays.</p>
    <p>Therefore, quasilinear preferences are <strong>non-homothetic</strong>. The income expansion path is NOT a straight line through the origin: as income increases, the demand for $y$ stays roughly constant (because the consumer's willingness to pay for $y$ is determined by MRS $= y$, which is independent of $x$), while all extra income goes toward $x$.</p>
    <p>Other examples of non-homothetic preferences include utility functions with subsistence levels, Stone-Geary utility, and any function where MRS depends on levels rather than ratios.</p>

    <h2>Quasilinear Utility $u(x,y) = x + \\ln y$: Strong Monotonicity</h2>
    <p>Yes, quasilinear preferences as given are strongly monotone on the domain $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $y > 0$.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$u_x = 1 > 0$</li>
      <li>$u_y = 1/y > 0$ for all $y > 0$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both partial derivatives are strictly positive. Therefore:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>More $x$ (holding $y$ fixed) always strictly increases utility by exactly 1 per unit.</li>
      <li>More $y$ (holding $x$ fixed) always strictly increases utility (by $1/y$ per unit, which is positive for $y > 0$).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since both marginal utilities are positive, increasing any component strictly increases utility. If $x \\geq x'$ and $x \\neq x'$, then $u(x) > u(x')$, satisfying strong monotonicity.</p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> as $y \\to 0^+$, $u_y = 1/y \\to \\infty$, meaning the marginal utility of $y$ becomes very large when $y$ is scarce (consistent with $\\ln y \\to -\\infty$ as $y \\to 0$).</p>

    $$x + \\ln y = \\bar{u} \\implies x = \\bar{u} - \\ln y \\implies y = e^{(\\bar{u} - x)}$$
    <h3>Key observations about the ICs</h3>
    <p><strong>Shape:</strong> Each IC is of the form $y = e^{(\\bar{u} - x)} = e^{\\bar{u}} \\cdot e^{-x}$. These are exponential decay curves — strictly decreasing and strictly convex. The ICs are all <strong>vertical translations</strong> of each other in the $(x, y)$ plane — each IC has exactly the same shape, just shifted up or down (for different $\\bar{u}$ values, only the constant $e^{\\bar{u}}$ changes).</p>
    <h3>Axis intersections</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>$x$-axis ($y = 0$):</strong> $y = e^{(\\bar{u} - x)} > 0$ for all finite $x$, so the IC never touches the $x$-axis ($y$ approaches 0 only as $x \\to +\\infty$). The IC does <strong>NOT cut the $x$-axis</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>$y$-axis ($x = 0$):</strong> $y = e^{\\bar{u}} > 0$, which is well-defined. The IC <strong>DOES cut the $y$-axis</strong> at $y = e^{\\bar{u}}$.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Homotheticity:</strong> Since all ICs are vertical shifts of one another (not radial expansions from the origin), they are NOT homothetic — the ICs for different utility levels are not scaled versions of each other.</p>

    <h2>Quasilinear Utility: $MRS_{x,y}$</h2>
    $$MRS_{x,y} = \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = \\frac{1}{1/y} = y$$
    <p>The MRS equals the quantity of $y$ currently consumed. This has several notable properties:</p>
    <p><strong>Depends only on $y$, not on $x$:</strong> No matter how much or how little $x$ the consumer has, the MRS is determined entirely by the level of $y$. This is the defining feature of quasilinear utility — the marginal utility of $x$ is constant ($= 1$), so the willingness to trade $y$ for $x$ depends only on how much $y$ the consumer already has.</p>
    <p><strong>Diminishing MRS:</strong> As $x$ increases along an IC (and $y$ falls accordingly), $MRS = y$ falls. The MRS is diminishing, confirming that quasilinear preferences are strictly convex.</p>
    <p><strong>Income effect on $y$ is zero:</strong> Because MRS $= y$ depends only on $y$, the optimal level of $y$ is pinned down by the price ratio alone ($MRS = p_x/p_y \\Rightarrow y^* = p_x/p_y$), independent of income. All income effects go entirely to good $x$. This is why quasilinear preferences are used to model goods with no income effect (e.g., numeraire goods).</p>
  `},
  {id: 52, title: "Quasilinear Preferences: Not Homothetic", html: `
    <h2>Quasilinear Preferences: Not Homothetic</h2>
    <p>No. Quasilinear preferences $u(x, y) = x + \\ln y$ are <strong>NOT homothetic</strong>.</p>
    <p>Recall: preferences are homothetic if $MRS_{x,y}$ depends only on the ratio $y/x$.</p>
    <p>For quasilinear utility, $MRS = y$. This depends only on the level of $y$ — not on the ratio $y/x$.</p>
    <p>To see why this violates homotheticity, consider two points on the same ray through the origin: $(x, y)$ and $(2x, 2y)$ (doubling both goods). At $(x, y)$: MRS $= y$. At $(2x, 2y)$: MRS $= 2y \\neq y$. The MRS changes as we scale up along the ray, so the preference relation is NOT homothetic.</p>
    <p>The income expansion path confirms this: as income increases (with prices fixed), the optimal $y^* = p_x/p_y$ stays constant ($y$ is a "luxury" with zero income elasticity in this model), while all additional income goes to $x$. This is non-homothetic behavior — homothetic preferences would require demand for both goods to scale proportionally with income.</p>
    <p>Quasilinear utility is specifically designed to capture situations where one good (here $x$, the numeraire) absorbs all income effects.</p>

    <p>Holding utility fixed at $\\bar{u}$, if $p_x$ rises by one euro, the increase in minimum expenditure is approximately equal to the amount of $x$ currently consumed.

    <hr>
    <h3>(a) Hängt die MRS von $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$ ab?</h3>
    <p><strong>Nein.</strong> Die Formel $MRS = (\\alpha/\\beta)(y/x)$ gilt unabhängig von der Normierung. Die Bedingung $\\alpha+\\beta=1$ ist lediglich eine <em>ordinale Normierung</em> für die Nutzenfunktion (man erhöht $u^{1/(\\alpha+\\beta)}$, was eine ordnungserhaltende Transformation ist). Sie vereinfacht Rechnungen, ändert aber die Präferenzen nicht.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>(b) Fall $y = x$</h3>
    <p>Wenn $y = x$: $MRS = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$</p>
    <p><strong>Intuition für $\\alpha > \\beta$:</strong> Der Konsument gewichtet Gut $x$ stärker. An der Diagonalen (gleiche Mengen) ist der Grenznutzen von $x$ relativ hoch → er ist bereit, mehr als eine Einheit $y$ aufzugeben, um eine Einheit $x$ zu erhalten → $MRS > 1$.</p>
    <p><em>Grafisch:</em> Die IC-Kurve schneidet die Diagonale $y=x$ mit einer Steigung $-\\alpha/\\beta$. Je größer $\\alpha$ relativ zu $\\beta$, desto steiler die IC an diesem Punkt.</p>

    <h3>(c) Subsistenzniveaus: $u(x,y) = (x-x_0)^\\alpha(y-y_0)^\\beta$ — Homothethisch?</h3>
    <p>Eine Funktion ist homothetisch, wenn die MRS nur vom Verhältnis $y/x$ abhängt (äquivalent: sie ist eine monotone Transformation einer homogenen Funktion).</p>
    <p>$$MRS = \\frac{\\alpha(x-x_0)^{\\alpha-1}(y-y_0)^\\beta}{\\beta(x-x_0)^\\alpha(y-y_0)^{\\beta-1}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\cdot\\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}$$</p>

    <p>Die MRS hängt <strong>nur vom Verhältnis $y/x$</strong> ab → <strong>homothetisch ✓</strong></p>
    <p>Formaler Beweis: $f(tx,ty) = \\alpha(tx)^\\delta/\\delta + \\beta(ty)^\\delta/\\delta = t^\\delta f(x,y)$ → $f$ ist homogen vom Grad $\\delta$, also ist $u$ eine monotone Transformation einer homogenen Funktion.</p>

    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Für $\\delta = -1$ ändert sich die MRS viermal stärker. Das entspricht stärker gekrümmten Indifferenzkurven → die Güter sind <em>komplementärer</em> zueinander, der Konsument ist weniger bereit zu substituieren.</p>

Das verbleibende <em>supernumeräre Einkommen</em> $\\tilde{I}$ wird im Verhältnis $\\alpha:\\beta$ auf $x$ und $y$ aufgeteilt — genau wie bei einer Standard-Cobb-Douglas-Funktion.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Teil (b): Ausgabenanteile und Engelkurven</h3>
    <p>Ausgabenanteil für $x$:</p>
    <p>$$\\frac{p_x x^*}{I} = \\frac{p_x x_0 + \\alpha(I - p_x x_0)}{I} = \\alpha + \\frac{(1-\\alpha)p_x x_0}{I}$$</p>
    <p>Ausgabenanteil für $y$:</p>
    <p>$$\\frac{p_y y^*}{I} = \\frac{\\beta(I-p_x x_0)}{I} = \\beta - \\frac{\\beta p_x x_0}{I}$$</p>
    <p>Wenn $I$ steigt ($x_0, p_x$ fest):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anteil für $x$ fällt (von oben gegen $\\alpha$) — $x$ ist ein <strong>notwendiges Gut</strong> (Engel-Gesetz)</li>
      <li>Anteil für $y$ steigt (von unten gegen $\\beta$) — $y$ ist ein <strong>normales Gut</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bei sehr hohem Einkommen nähern sich die Anteile den Cobb-Douglas-Werten $\\alpha$ und $\\beta$ an.</p>

    <p><strong>Schritt 1 — Marshallsche Nachfragen (aus FOC):</strong></p>
    <p>Lagrange-Bedingungen: $\\lambda p_x = x^{\\delta-1}(x^\\delta+y^\\delta)^{1/\\delta-1}$ und analog für $y$.</p>
    <p>Verhältnis: $\\frac{p_x}{p_y} = \\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right)^{\\delta-1} \\implies y = x\\left(\\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\right)^{1/(\\delta-1)}$</p>
    <p>Mit $1/(\\delta-1) = r/\\delta - 1$... nach Einsetzen ins Budget erhält man:</p>

    <p><strong>Schritt 2 — In Nutzenfunktion einsetzen:</strong></p>
    <p>Sei $D = p_x^r + p_y^r$. Dann $(x^*)^\\delta = I^\\delta p_x^{\\delta(r-1)}/D^\\delta$.</p>
    <p>Schlüsselidentität: $\\delta(r-1) = \\delta \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\delta-1} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta-1} = r$ ✓</p>
    <p>$$(x^*)^\\delta + (y^*)^\\delta = \\frac{I^\\delta(p_x^r+p_y^r)}{D^\\delta} = \\frac{I^\\delta}{D^{\\delta-1}}$$</p>

    <h3>Teil (e): Expenditure Function $E = V\\cdot(p_x^r+p_y^r)^{1/r}$</h3>
    <p>Aus der Dualität: $V = I\\cdot D^{-1/r}$ nach $I$ auflösen (setze $I = E$):</p>

    <p>Eine Verdopplung aller Preise verdoppelt die Mindestausgaben (keine Substitution möglich ohne Nutzenverlust).</p>

    <p>Alle Faktoren außer $(r-1)$ sind positiv. Für Konkavität brauchen wir $r - 1 \\leq 0$, d.h. $r \\leq 1$.</p>
    <p>Beweis: $r = \\delta/(\\delta-1) \\leq 1 \\iff \\delta/(\\delta-1) - 1 = 1/(\\delta-1) \\leq 0 \\iff \\delta - 1 < 0 \\iff \\delta < 1$ ✓</p>
    <p>Da CES-Nutzenfunktionen standardmäßig $\\delta < 1$ erfordern (damit $\\sigma > 0$), gilt $\\partial^2 E/\\partial p_x^2 \\leq 0$ ✓</p>
    <p><strong>Ökonomische Intuition:</strong> Steigt $p_x$, kann der Konsument zu $y$ substituieren → die Kostensteigerung ist schwächer als proportional → konkave Expenditure Function.</p>
