            <h2>What is Econometrics?</h2>
            <p><strong>Literal meaning:</strong> Measurement in Economics — but the field is much broader than just measuring.</p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Combined application of <strong>mathematical economics</strong>, <strong>mathematical statistics</strong>, and <strong>economic theory</strong></li>
              <li>Statistical verification of theoretically established doctrines</li>
              <li>Provides empirical evidence for relationships suggested by economic theory</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methods draw on</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Economic theory</li>
              <li>Mathematical language</li>
              <li>Statistical methods</li>
              <li>Software</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why do we need econometrics?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Description of data (e.g. inflation rate, income distribution)</li>
              <li>Quantification of economic relationships (theory often cannot make quantitative statements alone)</li>
              <li>Testing of economic theories</li>
              <li>Evaluating policy measures and making predictions</li>
              <li>Making economic decisions based on real-world data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Divided into <em>theoretical</em> vs. <em>applied</em> econometrics, and <em>micro-</em> vs. <em>macroeconometrics</em>.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Why is it an Independent Field?</h3>
            <p>The structure of economic problems and the characteristics of economic data frequently require the development of special methods. Many statistical procedures are designed for data generated in <strong>controlled experiments</strong> (laboratory settings).</p>
            <p>Controlled experiments are seldom used in economic research because they are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Often impossible</li>
              <li>Very costly</li>
              <li>Morally repugnant</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data used for inference is therefore primarily <strong>non-experimental, observed data</strong>. Economic data leads to certain problems, and a substantial part of theoretical econometrics is focused on developing procedures that work in the presence of and in spite of these problems.</p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Model:</strong> An economic model adequate for empirical use (from theory or ad hoc). Reality is more complex — correlation does not tell us anything about causation.</li>

        {id: 2, title: "Causality & Ceteris Paribus", html: `
            <h2>Causality &amp; the Ceteris Paribus Assumption</h2>
            <p>A key goal of econometrics is measuring <strong>causal effects</strong> between economic variables — not merely correlations.</p>
            <p>The typical target is to identify event/variable/state <em>A</em> as the cause of event/variable/state <em>B</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Does the change in class sizes have an effect on students' performance? If yes, to which extent?</p>
            <p>Questions can be qualitative (if?) and quantitative (how much?). The quantitative version asks: by how many points do test results change if class size changes by one student, given that all other factors remain unchanged (abilities, social status, etc.)?</p>
            <h3>Ceteris Paribus</h3>
            <p><em>"Under otherwise unchanged conditions — all other relevant factors being equal."</em></p>
            <p>This principle <strong>isolates a specific effect</strong> by holding other relevant variables constant.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Correlation vs. Causation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Correlation</strong> is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables</li>
              <li>Correlation does <strong>not</strong> indicate the direction of causality (causal effects)</li>
              <li>Regression relations do <strong>not</strong> imply causality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In observational data, several factors work and change simultaneously — not only the factor of interest. Econometric methods perform <strong>simultaneous impact analysis</strong> of various factors to isolate the effect of the variable of interest.</p>
            <p>The direction of causality in regression models is dictated by <strong>economic theory or intuition</strong>. A relevant statistical regression relation remains even if independent and dependent variables are swapped — only theory tells us the causal direction.</p>
            <h3>Reverse Causality</h3>
            <p>A modelling problem where the supposed <em>independent</em> variable is actually influenced by the <em>dependent</em> variable. This makes it difficult to establish the true causal direction from data alone.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Simple Linear Regression Model</h3>
            <p>The population model is: $$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + u$$</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>$y$</strong>: dependent (explained) variable</li>
              <li><strong>$x$</strong>: independent (explanatory) variable</li>
              <li><strong>$\\beta_0$</strong>: population intercept</li>
              <li><strong>$\\beta_1$</strong>: population slope — the ceteris paribus change in $y$ for a one-unit increase in $x$</li>
              <li><strong>$u$</strong>: error term — all unobserved factors affecting $y$ other than $x$</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The regression model distinguishes the dependent variable (e.g. wage) from independent variables (e.g. education, experience). The direction of causality is imposed by theory, not by the estimation.</p>

            <h2>Data Types &amp; Structures</h2>
            <p>Econometrics uses a variety of data sets. Some methods apply across data types with little adjustment; others require redevelopment depending on the data type.</p>
            <h3>Cross-Sectional Data</h3>
            <p>Observations of a sample of individuals, households, firms, cities, or countries at a <strong>single point in time</strong>. No natural ordering. Assumes random sampling from the population.</p>
            <p><em>Example (WAGE1.RAW): average hourly wages of 526 people in 1976, including education, experience, gender, marital status.</em></p>
            <p>If data is not obtained by random sampling, a <strong>sample-selection problem</strong> is present.</p>

            <h3>Pooled Cross-Sections</h3>
            <p>Data from <strong>different individuals</strong> at <strong>various time points</strong>, treated as one cross-section. Provides more observations and enables analysis of changes over time.</p>
            <p><em>Example: household surveys in 1996 and 1998 to evaluate a 1997 health reform.</em></p>

            <p>Data of the <strong>same cross-sectional units</strong> (individuals, firms, countries) observed at <strong>multiple time periods</strong>.</p>
            <p>Panel data allows control of so-called <strong>unobserved individual effects</strong> as well as the analysis of lagged effects.</p>

            <p>One observation per time period; <strong>chronological order matters</strong>. Observations are typically not independent from each other — strong serial correlation over time (e.g. GDP).</p>
            <p>Notation: $x_t$, $t = 1, \\ldots, T$. Data frequency: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually.</p>

        `},
        {id: 24, title: "The Error Term in Regression", html: `
            <h2>The Error Term in Regression</h2>
            <p>In the simple linear regression model $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + u$, the error term <strong>$u$</strong> collects all influences on the dependent variable $y$ that are not captured by the explanatory variable $x$.</p>
            <h3>What the Error Term Contains</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Omitted variables:</strong> factors that affect $y$ but are not included (e.g. ability in a wage equation)</li>
              <li><strong>Measurement errors:</strong> imprecisions in recording $y$ or $x$</li>
              <li><strong>Unpredictable random shocks:</strong> inherently stochastic influences on the outcome</li>
              <li><strong>Incorrect functional form:</strong> if the true relationship is non-linear but a linear model is used</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because $u$ contains all these unrecorded factors, it is <strong>unobservable</strong>. We can only estimate it via the OLS residuals $\\hat{u}_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$, which are the sample counterparts of the population errors.</p>
            <h3>Why the Error Term is Crucial</h3>
            <p>No economic model perfectly describes reality. The error term acknowledges this gap. Without it, every prediction would have to be exact — which is never the case with real-world data.</p>
            <p>The error term is also what makes the model <em>stochastic</em>: $u$ is treated as a random variable, so $y$ is also a random variable conditional on $x$.</p>
            <h3>Population Regression Function</h3>
            <p>Taking conditional expectations: $E(y|x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ (assuming $E(u|x) = 0$).</p>
            <p>This is the <strong>Population Regression Function (PRF)</strong> — the average value of $y$ for a given $x$ in the population.</p>
            <h3>Example: Fertility Model</h3>
            <p>In the model $kids = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot educ + u$, the error term $u$ captures unobserved factors affecting fertility: income, age, family background, religion, and individual preferences — all of which are omitted from this simple specification.</p>
        `},
        {id: 25, title: "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)", html: `
            <h2>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</h2>
            <p>OLS is the standard method for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model. It produces the <strong>Sample Regression Function (SRF)</strong>: $\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x$.</p>
            <h3>The Objective</h3>
            <p>OLS minimizes the <strong>sum of squared residuals (SSR)</strong>:</p>
            <p>$$SSR = \\sum_i \\hat{u}_i^2 = \\sum_i (y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i)^2$$</p>
            <p>Squaring residuals ensures that positive and negative deviations do not cancel out, and penalizes large errors more than small ones.</p>
            <h3>Deriving the OLS Estimators</h3>
            <p>Taking partial derivatives of SSR with respect to $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and setting them to zero (First Order Conditions) yields:</p>
            <p><strong>OLS slope estimator:</strong></p>
            <p>$$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$</p>
            <p>This can also be written as: $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\widehat{Cov}(x, y)}{\\widehat{Var}(x)}$</p>
            <p><strong>OLS intercept estimator:</strong></p>
            <p>$$\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x}$$</p>
            <h3>Key Algebraic Properties</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The OLS regression line always passes through the sample means $(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$</li>
              <li>The sum of residuals is always zero: $\\sum \\hat{u}_i = 0$</li>
              <li>Residuals are uncorrelated with $x$ by construction: $\\widehat{Cov}(x, \\hat{u}) = 0$</li>
              <li>Residuals are uncorrelated with fitted values: $\\widehat{Cov}(\\hat{y}, \\hat{u}) = 0$</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Residuals vs. Population Errors</h3>
            <p>The population error $u_i = y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x_i$ is unobservable. The OLS residual $\\hat{u}_i = y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i$ is its observable sample counterpart.</p>
            <h3>The Method of Moments Connection</h3>
            <p>OLS can also be derived via the <strong>Method of Moments</strong>: the population assumptions $E(u) = 0$ and $Cov(x, u) = 0$ are replaced by their sample analogues, yielding the same estimator formulas.</p>
        `},
        {id: 26, title: "Zero Conditional Mean Assumption", html: `
            <h2>Zero Conditional Mean Assumption</h2>
            <p>The assumption $E(u|x) = 0$ is the most critical assumption for unbiasedness of OLS. It states that, for any value of $x$, the average value of the unobserved error term is zero.</p>
            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <p>This means the unobservable factors captured in $u$ are <strong>not systematically related to $x$</strong> — on average, knowing $x$ gives us no information about $u$. Formally:</p>
            <p>$$E(u|x) = 0 \\text{ for all values of } x$$</p>
            <p>This is sometimes called <strong>mean independence</strong> of $u$ from $x$.</p>
            <h3>Consequences of the Assumption</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>It implies $E(u) = 0$ (unconditionally)</li>
              <li>It implies $Cov(x, u) = 0$ (zero covariance between $x$ and $u$), via the Law of Iterated Expectations</li>
              <li>It allows us to write the <strong>Population Regression Function</strong>: $E(y|x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When is it Violated?</h3>
            <p>The assumption fails when an omitted variable is correlated with $x$. For example, in a wage regression $wage = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot educ + u$, if unobserved ability is in $u$ and is correlated with education, then $E(u|educ) \\neq 0$ and OLS is biased.</p>
            <h3>Important Distinction</h3>
            <p>$Cov(x, u) = 0$ does <strong>not</strong> imply $E(u|x) = 0$. Zero covariance rules out only linear dependence. The zero conditional mean assumption is stronger — it rules out any systematic relationship between $u$ and $x$.</p>
            <h3>Homoskedasticity</h3>
            <p>A related assumption is <strong>homoskedasticity</strong>: $Var(u|x) = \\sigma^2$ (constant for all $x$). Together with zero conditional mean, this gives the full classical OLS framework. If variance is not constant, the model is <strong>heteroskedastic</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic Properties of OLS</h2>
            <p>These properties hold by construction in any OLS estimation — they are consequences of the minimization of the sum of squared residuals, not additional assumptions.</p>
            <h3>Property 1: Residuals Sum to Zero</h3>
            <p>$$\\sum_i \\hat{u}_i = 0$$</p>
            <p>This follows from the first-order condition for the intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$. It means the sample average of the residuals is always zero: $\\bar{\\hat{u}} = 0$.</p>
            <h3>Property 2: Regression Line Through the Means</h3>
            <p>The OLS line always passes through $(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$. The intercept formula $\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x}$ guarantees this.</p>
            <h3>Property 3: Residuals Uncorrelated with x</h3>
            <p>$\\sum_i x_i \\hat{u}_i = 0$, or equivalently $\\widehat{Cov}(x, \\hat{u}) = 0$.</p>
            <p>This follows from the first-order condition for the slope $\\hat{\\beta}_1$.</p>
            <h3>Property 4: Residuals Uncorrelated with Fitted Values</h3>
            <p>$\\sum_i \\hat{y}_i \\hat{u}_i = 0$, or equivalently $\\widehat{Cov}(\\hat{y}, \\hat{u}) = 0$.</p>
            <h3>Variance Decomposition</h3>
            <p>A key identity following from these properties is:</p>
            <p>$$SST = SSE + SSR$$</p>
            <ul>
              <li>$SST = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ — Total Sum of Squares (total variation in $y$)</li>
              <li>$SSE = \\sum(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2$ — Explained Sum of Squares (variation explained by $x$)</li>
              <li>$SSR = \\sum \\hat{u}_i^2$ — Residual Sum of Squares (unexplained variation)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Regression on a Constant Only</h3>
            <p>If no explanatory variable $x$ is included (only an intercept), the OLS estimate of the intercept is the sample mean $\\bar{y}$. This is because the sample mean minimizes the sum of squared deviations.</p>

        {id: 29, title: "Goodness of Fit: R²", html: `
            <h2>Goodness of Fit: $R^2$</h2>
            <p>The <strong>coefficient of determination $R^2$</strong> measures how well the regression model explains the variation in the dependent variable.</p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>$$R^2 = \\frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \\frac{SSR}{SST}$$</p>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>$SST = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ = total variation in $y$</li>
              <li>$SSE = \\sum(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2$ = explained variation</li>
              <li>$SSR = \\sum \\hat{u}_i^2$ = unexplained variation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>$R^2 = 0$: $x$ explains none of the variation in $y$; the regression line is flat at $\\bar{y}$</li>
              <li>$R^2 = 1$: all data points lie exactly on the regression line; perfect fit</li>
              <li>$0 &lt; R^2 &lt; 1$: $x$ explains a fraction $R^2$ of the total variation in $y$</li>
            </ul>
            <p>$R^2$ cannot be negative in OLS with an intercept.</p>
            <h3>Connection to Correlation</h3>
            <p>In simple linear regression, $R^2$ equals the <strong>square of the sample correlation coefficient</strong> between $y$ and $\\hat{y}$ (or equivalently between $y$ and $x$). So $R^2 = r^2_{xy}$.</p>
            <h3>Limitations of $R^2$</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>A high $R^2$ does not mean the model is correctly specified or that causal inference is valid</li>
              <li>$R^2$ cannot decrease when more regressors are added (even irrelevant ones), which is why adjusted $R^2$ is used in multiple regression</li>
              <li>A low $R^2$ is not necessarily bad — in many economic applications, $R^2$ of 0.3 or less is common because human behavior has many unpredictable components</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>If a wage regression on education has $R^2 = 0.19$, then education explains 19% of the variation in wages in the sample. The remaining 81% is attributable to other factors (experience, ability, occupation, etc.).</p>

        {id: 30, title: "OLS Assumptions (SLR.1–SLR.4) & Unbiasedness", html: `
            <h2>OLS Assumptions (SLR.1–SLR.4) and Unbiasedness</h2>
            <p>For OLS to be an <strong>unbiased</strong> estimator of the true population parameters, four assumptions must hold:</p>
            <h3>SLR.1 — Linear in Parameters</h3>
            <p>The population model is: $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + u$</p>
            <p>The model must be linear in the <em>parameters</em> $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ (not necessarily linear in variables — log transformations are permitted).</p>
            <h3>SLR.2 — Random Sampling</h3>
            <p>The sample $\{(x_i, y_i): i = 1, \\ldots, n\}$ is a random sample from the population. Each observation is an independent draw following the population model.</p>
            <h3>SLR.3 — Sample Variation in x</h3>
            <p>The sample values of $x$ are not all identical: $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 > 0$.</p>
            <p>If all $x_i$ are the same, the denominator of the slope formula is zero and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ cannot be computed — there is no information about how $y$ changes with $x$.</p>
            <h3>SLR.4 — Zero Conditional Mean</h3>
            <p>$$E(u|x) = 0$$</p>
            <p>The error term has zero conditional mean for any value of $x$. This is the key assumption ensuring that the OLS estimator targets the correct population parameter.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Unbiasedness of OLS</h3>
            <p>Under SLR.1–SLR.4, the OLS estimators are <strong>unbiased</strong>:</p>
            <p>$$E(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\beta_0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\beta_1$$</p>
            <p>This means that, on average across all possible random samples, the OLS estimator hits the true population parameter — even though any single sample estimate may differ from the truth.</p>
            <p>Note: the fifth assumption SLR.5 (homoskedasticity) is additionally needed for the Gauss-Markov theorem (efficiency of OLS), but <em>not</em> for unbiasedness.</p>
        `},
        {id: 31, title: "Sample Variation in x (SLR.3)", html: `
            <h2>Sample Variation in $x$ (SLR.3)</h2>
            <p>Assumption SLR.3 requires that not all sample values of the explanatory variable are identical.</p>
            <h3>Why it is Needed</h3>
            <p>The OLS slope estimator is:</p>
            <p>$$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$</p>
            <p>If all $x_i$ are equal to the same value, then $x_i - \\bar{x} = 0$ for every observation, so the denominator $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = 0$. Division by zero makes the slope estimator undefined.</p>
            <h3>Economic Intuition</h3>
            <p>If every person in the sample has the same level of education, we cannot learn anything about how wages vary with education. We need variation in the explanatory variable to identify its effect on the dependent variable.</p>
            <h3>In Practice</h3>
            <p>This assumption is almost always satisfied in real economic data sets. However, it can be problematic in designed experiments where treatment is not varied, or in data sets where a variable has been incorrectly recorded as constant.</p>
            <h3>Connection to Multicollinearity</h3>
            <p>In multiple regression, an analogous problem arises when two or more explanatory variables are perfectly correlated (perfect multicollinearity). In that case, the OLS estimators also cannot be computed uniquely.</p>
        `},
        {id: 32, title: "Dummy Variable Regression", html: `
            <h2>Dummy Variable Regression</h2>
            <p>A <strong>dummy variable</strong> (also called a binary or indicator variable) takes only the values 0 or 1, representing membership in a category (e.g. female = 1, male = 0).</p>
            <h3>OLS with a Dummy Regressor</h3>
            <p>When $x$ is a binary variable, the OLS slope estimator simplifies to a particularly intuitive formula:</p>
            <p>$$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_0$$</p>
            <p>where $\\bar{y}_1$ is the sample mean of $y$ for observations with $x = 1$, and $\\bar{y}_0$ is the sample mean for $x = 0$.</p>
            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <p>The estimated slope is simply the <strong>difference in mean outcomes</strong> between the two groups. The intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ equals $\\bar{y}_0$, the mean outcome for the base group ($x = 0$).</p>
            <p><em>Example: regressing wage on a female dummy gives $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ = average female wage $-$ average male wage.</em></p>
            <h3>Caution</h3>
            <p>This difference in means is not a causal estimate unless $E(u|x) = 0$ — i.e. unless the two groups are comparable in all unobserved respects. In observational data, men and women may differ in education, experience, and occupation, so the dummy regression captures more than just a gender effect.</p>
            <h3>Multiple Dummies</h3>
            <p>For a categorical variable with $k$ categories, use $k - 1$ dummy variables (the omitted category is the base group). Including all $k$ dummies would cause perfect multicollinearity (the dummy trap).</p>

        {id: 33, title: "Units of Measurement & Rescaling", html: `
            <h2>Units of Measurement and Rescaling</h2>
            <p>Changing the units in which variables are measured does not affect the underlying economic relationship, but it does change the numerical values of the OLS estimates in predictable ways.</p>
            <h3>Rescaling the Dependent Variable $y$</h3>
            <p>If $y$ is multiplied by a constant $c$ (e.g. converting wages from dollars to cents, $c = 100$), then both $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ are multiplied by $c$. The fitted values and residuals are also multiplied by $c$. $R^2$ is unchanged.</p>
            <h3>Rescaling the Independent Variable $x$</h3>
            <p>If $x$ is multiplied by a constant $c$ (e.g. converting education from years to months, $c = 12$), then $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is <strong>divided</strong> by $c$. The intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ is unchanged. $R^2$ is unchanged.</p>
            <p>Intuition: the total predicted effect $\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\cdot \\Delta x$ must remain the same. If $x$ is measured in larger units (bigger $c$), each unit of $x$ represents more, so $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ must be smaller to keep the product constant.</p>
            <h3>General Rule</h3>
            <table>
              <tr><th>Change</th><th>Effect on $\\hat{\\beta}_0$</th><th>Effect on $\\hat{\\beta}_1$</th><th>Effect on $R^2$</th></tr>
              <tr><td>$y \\to c \\cdot y$</td><td>$\\times c$</td><td>$\\times c$</td><td>unchanged</td></tr>
              <tr><td>$x \\to c \\cdot x$</td><td>unchanged</td><td>$\\div c$</td><td>unchanged</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h3>Practical Implication</h3>
            <p>Always report the units of measurement alongside regression coefficients. A slope of 0.5 means something completely different depending on whether $y$ is in dollars or thousands of dollars.</p>

            <h2>Variance of the OLS Estimator</h2>
            <p>Under the assumptions SLR.1–SLR.5 (including homoskedasticity), the variance of the OLS slope estimator is:</p>

            <h3>Three Key Factors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Error variance $\\sigma^2$:</strong> more noise in the data $\\to$ larger variance of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. This is outside the researcher's control.</li>
              <li><strong>Sample variation in $x$:</strong> $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$ in the denominator — more variation in $x$ $\\to$ smaller variance $\\to$ more precise estimates.</li>
              <li><strong>Sample size $n$:</strong> larger $n$ increases $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, so $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ becomes more precise as $n$ grows.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Standard Error of the Regression (SER)</h3>
            <p>The error variance $\\sigma^2$ is unknown and must be estimated. The unbiased estimator is:</p>
            <p>$$\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{SSR}{n - 2}$$</p>
            <p>The denominator is $n - 2$ (not $n$) because two degrees of freedom are used to estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. The SER is $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}$.</p>
            <h3>Standard Errors of the Estimates</h3>
            <p>The standard error of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is: $se(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}$</p>
            <p>Standard errors measure the <strong>precision</strong> of the OLS estimates. They are essential for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.</p>

        {id: 35, title: "Omitted Variable Bias", html: `
            <h2>Omitted Variable Bias</h2>
            <p>Omitted variable bias (OVB) occurs when a variable that belongs in the true population model is excluded from the estimated regression, and that omitted variable is <strong>correlated with an included explanatory variable</strong>.</p>
            <h3>When Does Bias Arise?</h3>
            <p>Two conditions must both hold for OVB:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The omitted variable affects the dependent variable $y$</li>
              <li>The omitted variable is correlated with the included explanatory variable $x$</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If either condition fails, OLS remains unbiased even without the omitted variable.</p>
            <h3>Direction of the Bias</h3>
            <p>If the omitted variable is positively correlated with $x$ and positively affects $y$, then the OLS slope estimate for $x$ will be <strong>upward biased</strong> (too large). The bias is reversed if the signs differ.</p>
            <p><em>Example: Regressing wages on education while omitting ability. Ability is positively correlated with education (smarter people get more education) and positively affects wages. So the estimated return to education is upward biased — it captures some of the ability premium.</em></p>
            <h3>Violation of SLR.4</h3>
            <p>OVB is a violation of the zero conditional mean assumption: $E(u|x) \\neq 0$. The omitted variable is in $u$, and since it correlates with $x$, $u$ is not mean-independent of $x$.</p>
            <h3>Consequences</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The OLS estimator is biased: $E(\\hat{\\beta}_1) \\neq \\beta_1$</li>
              <li>More data does not fix the problem — the bias persists even with very large samples</li>
              <li>The solution requires either including the omitted variable, using an instrumental variable, or a natural experiment</li>

        {id: 36, title: "Average Treatment Effect (ATE)", html: `
            <h2>Average Treatment Effect (ATE)</h2>
            <p>The <strong>potential outcomes framework</strong> provides a formal way to define causal effects. Each unit $i$ has two potential outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>$y(1)$: the outcome if unit $i$ receives treatment</li>
              <li>$y(0)$: the outcome if unit $i$ does not receive treatment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>individual treatment effect</strong> is $y(1) - y(0)$, but this is never observed — we only ever see one of the two potential outcomes for any given unit (the fundamental problem of causal inference).</p>
            <h3>Average Treatment Effect</h3>
            <p>$$ATE = E[y(1) - y(0)] = E[y(1)] - E[y(0)]$$</p>
            <p>This is the average causal effect of the treatment across the entire population.</p>
            <h3>When is the ATE Identified?</h3>
            <p>Under <strong>random assignment</strong> of treatment (e.g. in a randomized controlled trial), treatment status is independent of potential outcomes: $(y(0), y(1)) \\perp x$. In that case:</p>
            <p>$$ATE = E(y|x=1) - E(y|x=0) = \\hat{\\beta}_1$$</p>
            <p>from a simple regression of $y$ on $x$.</p>
            <p>With random assignment, the OLS slope in a binary dummy regression recovers the ATE without bias.</p>
            <h3>In Observational Data</h3>
            <p>When treatment is not randomly assigned (e.g. people self-select into education), the simple difference in means confounds the treatment effect with selection bias. Econometric methods (IV, panel data, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity) attempt to recover causal effects from non-experimental data.</p>

            <p>This property follows directly from the first-order condition for minimizing SSR with respect to $\\hat{\\beta}_0$:</p>
            <p>$$\\frac{\\partial SSR}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_0} = 0 \\implies \\sum \\hat{u}_i = 0 \\implies \\bar{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x}$$</p>
            <h3>Practical Significance</h3>
            <p>This property guarantees that the OLS regression line is anchored at the center of the data. It also means the intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ is not independently chosen — it is determined once $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and the sample means are known.</p>

            <h2>Probability: Variance and Covariance</h2>
            <p>Variance and covariance are the core building blocks of the statistical theory underlying econometrics.</p>
            <h3>Variance</h3>
            <p>For a random variable $X$: $Var(X) = E[(X - E(X))^2] = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2$</p>
            <p>The standard deviation is $sd(X) = \\sqrt{Var(X)}$.</p>
            <h3>Properties of Variance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>$Var(a + bX) = b^2 \\cdot Var(X)$ — adding a constant has no effect; scaling by $b$ squares the effect on variance</li>
              <li>$Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2 \\cdot Cov(X, Y)$ — variance of a sum</li>
              <li>If $X$ and $Y$ are independent: $Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)$</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Covariance</h3>
            <p>$$Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))] = E(XY) - E(X) \\cdot E(Y)$$</p>
            <p>Covariance measures the direction of linear association:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Positive: $X$ and $Y$ tend to move together</li>
              <li>Negative: $X$ and $Y$ tend to move in opposite directions</li>
              <li>Zero: no linear association (but not necessarily independent)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Properties of Covariance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>$Cov(a + bX, c + dY) = bd \\cdot Cov(X, Y)$</li>
              <li>$Cov(X, X) = Var(X)$</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Normal Distribution</h3>
            <p>If $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, then a linear transformation $Y = a + bX$ is also normal: $Y \\sim N(a + b\\mu,\ b^2\\sigma^2)$. This closure property is important for deriving the distributions of OLS estimators.</p>

        {id: 39, title: "Mean Independence", html: `
            <h2>Mean Independence</h2>
            <p><strong>Mean independence</strong> of $u$ from $x$ means: $E(u|x) = E(u)$</p>
            <p>The conditional mean of $u$ does not depend on the value of $x$ — knowing $x$ tells us nothing about the average value of $u$.</p>
            <h3>Relationship to Zero Conditional Mean</h3>
            <p>The OLS assumption SLR.4 requires the stronger condition $E(u|x) = 0$. Since we typically also assume $E(u) = 0$ (which can always be arranged by including an intercept), $E(u|x) = E(u) = 0$ is equivalent to mean independence when the unconditional mean is zero.</p>
            <h3>Implication: Zero Covariance</h3>
            <p>Mean independence implies: $Cov(x, u) = E(xu) - E(x) \\cdot E(u) = 0$</p>
            <p>This follows from the Law of Iterated Expectations: $E(xu) = E[x \\cdot E(u|x)] = E[x \\cdot E(u)] = E(x) \\cdot E(u)$.</p>
            <h3>Mean Independence vs. Full Independence</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Full independence:</strong> $u$ and $x$ share no statistical relationship whatsoever</li>
              <li><strong>Mean independence:</strong> only the conditional <em>mean</em> of $u$ is unrelated to $x$ (higher moments like variance could still depend on $x$)</li>
              <li><strong>Zero covariance:</strong> only the <em>linear</em> relationship between $u$ and $x$ is zero (weakest condition)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For unbiasedness of OLS, mean independence is the required condition. Homoskedasticity additionally requires that $Var(u|x) = \\sigma^2$ — that the variance does not depend on $x$ either.</p>

            <h2>Regression Through the Origin</h2>
            <p>Regression through the origin forces the fitted line to pass through the point $(0, 0)$ by suppressing the intercept:</p>
            <p>$$y = \\beta_1 x + u$$</p>
            <p>The OLS slope estimator in this restricted model is:</p>
            <p>$$\\tilde{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum x_i y_i}{\\sum x_i^2}$$</p>
            <h3>When to Use it</h3>
            <p>This model is appropriate only when economic theory strongly predicts that $E(y|x=0) = 0$. For example, a firm with zero employees should produce zero output.</p>
            <h3>Why It Is Rarely Used</h3>
            <p>If the true population intercept $\\beta_0$ is not zero, suppressing it causes the slope estimator to be <strong>biased</strong>. In practice, it is very hard to justify $\\beta_0 = 0$ with certainty, so most applied work includes an intercept as a safety measure.</p>
            <h3>Different Algebraic Properties</h3>
            <p>Without an intercept, the standard algebraic properties of OLS no longer hold:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The residuals do not necessarily sum to zero: $\\sum \\hat{u}_i \\neq 0$</li>
              <li>The regression line does not necessarily pass through $(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})$</li>
              <li>The standard $R^2$ formula can give misleading values (or even be negative)</li>

            <h2>Log-Log Model: Constant Elasticity</h2>
            <p>The log-log model specifies both the dependent and explanatory variables in natural logarithms:</p>
            <p>$$\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\log(x) + u$$</p>
            <h3>Interpretation of $\\beta_1$</h3>
            <p>The slope coefficient $\\beta_1$ is the <strong>elasticity</strong> of $y$ with respect to $x$: a 1% increase in $x$ leads to a $\\beta_1\%$ change in $y$, regardless of the level of $x$. This is the defining feature of a constant elasticity model.</p>
            <h3>Why Use Logs?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Many economic relationships are proportional rather than additive — e.g. a 1% increase in advertising budget raises sales by a constant percentage</li>
              <li>Log transformation can reduce the impact of outliers and skewness</li>
              <li>Coefficients have a natural percentage-change interpretation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>In a house price regression: $\\log(price) = \\beta_0 + 0.312 \\cdot \\log(dist) + u$</p>
            <p>A 10% increase in distance from the incinerator raises house prices by about 3.12%.</p>
            <h3>Comparison with Other Log Models</h3>
            <p>In a <strong>log-level</strong> (semi-log) model, $\\beta_1$ is a semi-elasticity (the effect of a one-unit change in $x$ on the percentage change in $y$). In a <strong>level-log</strong> model, a percentage change in $x$ has a constant absolute effect on $y$. The log-log model is the only one where $\\beta_1$ is a pure elasticity.</p>

        {id: 42, title: "Method of Moments", html: `
            <h2>Method of Moments</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Method of Moments</strong> is a general principle for constructing estimators by replacing population moments with their sample counterparts.</p>
            <h3>General Idea</h3>
            <p>If we know that a population parameter satisfies some moment condition — e.g. $E[g(X, \\theta)] = 0$ — we estimate $\\theta$ by solving the sample analogue: $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum g(x_i, \\hat{\\theta}) = 0$.</p>
            <h3>Application to OLS</h3>
            <p>The OLS assumptions imply two population moment conditions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>$E(u) = 0$ $\\to$ Sample analogue: $\\sum \\hat{u}_i = 0$</li>
              <li>$E(xu) = 0$ $\\to$ Sample analogue: $\\sum x_i \\hat{u}_i = 0$</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Substituting $\\hat{u}_i = y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i$ and solving these two equations yields exactly the OLS estimators $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. This shows OLS is a special case of the Method of Moments.</p>
            <h3>Example: Pareto Distribution</h3>
            <p>For the PDF $f(x) = a \\cdot x^{-a-1}$ ($x \\geq 1$), the population mean is $E(X) = \\frac{a}{a-1}$. Setting the sample mean equal: $\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\hat{a}}{\\hat{a}-1}$ and solving gives the MM estimator $\\hat{a}_{MM} = \\frac{\\bar{x}}{\\bar{x}-1}$.</p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Does not require a full distributional assumption — only moment conditions</li>
              <li>Conceptually transparent: match sample moments to population moments</li>
              <li>Generalizes to GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) for more complex models</li>

            <h2>Standard Errors and Precision</h2>
            <p>A <strong>standard error</strong> is the estimated standard deviation of an estimator's sampling distribution. It quantifies how much the estimate would vary across different random samples from the same population.</p>
            <h3>Standard Error of the OLS Slope</h3>
            <p>$$se(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}$$</p>
            <p>where $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{SSR/(n-2)}$ is the Standard Error of the Regression (SER).</p>
            <h3>What Determines Precision?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Larger $n$:</strong> more observations $\\to$ smaller $se(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ $\\to$ more precise estimates</li>
              <li><strong>More variation in $x$:</strong> larger $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$ $\\to$ smaller $se(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$</li>

            <h3>Standard Error of the Regression (SER)</h3>
            <p>The SER is: $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{SSR/(n-2)}$</p>
            <p>It estimates the standard deviation of the population error term $\\sigma$. A smaller SER indicates the model's predicted values are on average closer to the observed outcomes.</p>

            <h3>What Random Sampling Means</h3>
            <p>Each observation $(x_i, y_i)$ is an independent draw from the same population distribution. Observations do not depend on each other — conditional on $x$, the $y_i$ are independent across $i$.</p>
            <h3>Why Order Does Not Matter in Cross-Sections</h3>
            <p>Because observations are independent random draws, the order in which they appear in the data set carries no statistical information. Rearranging observations does not change any OLS estimates or standard errors.</p>
            <p>This is in sharp contrast to time series data, where the ordering is essential because observations are typically correlated over time.</p>
            <h3>When is Random Sampling Violated?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sample selection bias:</strong> units with certain characteristics are more likely to be included (e.g. only employed workers in a wage study)</li>
              <li><strong>Cluster sampling:</strong> students within the same school are not independent</li>
              <li><strong>Stratified sampling:</strong> deliberate overrepresentation of certain groups</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Limitations of Correlation</h3>
            <p>Correlation (and covariance) measure only <strong>linear</strong> relationships. Two variables can be strongly non-linearly related yet have zero correlation. Moreover, correlation does not imply causation — a high correlation may be due to a common third cause.</p>
            <h3>Independence vs. Zero Covariance</h3>
            <p>If $X$ and $Y$ are statistically independent, their covariance is zero. But zero covariance does not imply independence — for example, $X$ and $X^2$ have zero covariance when $X$ is symmetric around zero, yet they are clearly dependent.</p>
            <h3>Connection to OLS</h3>
            <p>The OLS slope estimator can be written as: $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\widehat{Cov}(x, y)}{\\widehat{Var}(x)}$. The sign of the slope equals the sign of the sample covariance (and correlation) between $x$ and $y$.</p>

            <p>The <strong>conditional expectation</strong> $E(Y|X = x) = \\int y \\cdot f(y|x)\, dy$ is the average value of $Y$ for a given value of $x$.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The effect of $x$ on $y$ is diminishing — each additional percentage increase in $x$ adds a constant amount to $y$</li>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>In a wage regression: $wage = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\log(exper) + u$</p>
            <p>An additional year of experience matters more early in a career than later. A 1% increase in experience always raises wage by $\\beta_1/100$ dollars, regardless of the current level of experience.</p>
            <h3>Comparison Across Functional Forms</h3>
            <p>The level-log model captures diminishing returns from $x$ in a simple way, without requiring a quadratic term. It is intermediate between the pure level-level model (constant marginal effect) and the log-log model (constant elasticity).</p>

            <h2>Standard Errors in Regression Output</h2>
            <p>Standard errors appear alongside coefficient estimates in every regression table and are central to statistical inference.</p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>The standard error of an estimator is the estimated standard deviation of its sampling distribution. For the OLS slope:</p>
            <p>$$se(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}$$</p>
            <p>where $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\sqrt{SSR/(n-2)}$ is the Standard Error of the Regression.</p>
            <h3>What Standard Errors Tell Us</h3>
            <p>A small standard error means the estimator is precise — repeated sampling from the same population would produce similar estimates. A large standard error means high sampling variability — the estimate is unreliable.</p>
            <h3>t-Statistics</h3>
            <p>The $t$-statistic tests whether a coefficient is statistically different from zero:</p>
            <p>$$t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_1}{se(\\hat{\\beta}_1)}$$</p>
            <p>Under the null hypothesis $\\beta_1 = 0$, this follows a $t$-distribution with $n - 2$ degrees of freedom.</p>
            <h3>p-Values</h3>
            <p>The $p$-value is the probability of observing a $t$-statistic at least as extreme as the calculated one, under the null hypothesis. A very small $p$-value (e.g. &lt; 0.05) leads to rejection of the null hypothesis — the variable is <strong>statistically significant</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Reading Regression Output</h3>
            <p>A typical regression table reports: coefficient estimate, standard error, $t$-statistic, and $p$-value for each regressor, plus $R^2$, SER, and the number of observations.</p>

            <h2>Linear in Parameters (SLR.1)</h2>
            <p>Assumption SLR.1 requires that the population model can be written as:</p>
            <p>$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + u$$</p>
            <p>where $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are unknown population parameters and $u$ is an unobserved error term.</p>
            <h3>What Linear in Parameters Means</h3>
            <p>The model must be linear in the <em>parameters</em> $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ — the parameters enter additively and are not raised to any power, multiplied together, or appear inside a non-linear function. However, the <em>variables</em> $x$ and $y$ may be non-linear transformations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>$\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + u$ — linear in parameters, $y$ is transformed</li>
              <li>$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x^2 + u$ — linear in parameters, $x$ is transformed</li>
              <li>$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\log(x) + u$ — linear in parameters, $x$ is logged</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Non-linear Models</h3>
            <p>Models like $y = \\beta_0 \\cdot \\exp(\\beta_1 x) + u$ are <strong>not</strong> linear in parameters and cannot be estimated by standard OLS without transformation. Such models require non-linear estimation methods.</p>
            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>The linearity-in-parameters assumption is what allows the closed-form OLS formula to work. It ensures the SSR minimization problem has a unique analytical solution given the other assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Expected Value and the Law of Iterated Expectations</h2>
            <p>Expected value is the population mean of a random variable and is the foundation of all moment-based econometric theory.</p>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>For a discrete random variable: $E(X) = \\sum x \\cdot f(x)$</p>
            <p>For a continuous random variable: $E(X) = \\int x \\cdot f(x)\, dx$</p>
            <h3>Linearity of Expectation</h3>
            <p>For constants $a$, $b$ and random variables $X$, $Y$:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>$E(a + bX) = a + b \\cdot E(X)$</li>
              <li>$E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$ (always, even if $X$ and $Y$ are dependent)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conditional Expectation</h3>
            <p>$E(Y|X = x) = \\int y \\cdot f(y|x)\, dy$ — the average of $Y$ for a given value of $X$.</p>
            <p>This is a function of $x$, not a single number.</p>
            <h3>Law of Iterated Expectations (LIE)</h3>
            <p>$$E(Y) = E[E(Y|X)]$$</p>
            <p>The unconditional mean equals the average of the conditional means. This law is used repeatedly in econometrics:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Proving that $E(u|x) = 0$ implies $E(u) = 0$</li>
              <li>Proving that $E(u|x) = 0$ implies $Cov(x, u) = 0$</li>
              <li>Defining the Population Regression Function as $E(y|x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Jensen's Inequality</h3>
            <p>For a convex function $g$: $E[g(X)] \\geq g(E(X))$. This implies, for example, that $E(X^2) \\geq [E(X)]^2$, which is why $Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 \\geq 0$.</p>

        {id: 52, title: "Normal Distribution and Standardization", html: `
            <h2>Normal Distribution and Standardization</h2>
            <p>The normal distribution plays a central role in econometrics because OLS estimators are normally distributed under the classical assumptions with normally distributed errors.</p>
            <h3>The Normal Distribution</h3>
            <p>A random variable $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ has:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mean: $E(X) = \\mu$</li>
              <li>Variance: $Var(X) = \\sigma^2$</li>
              <li>Bell-shaped, symmetric PDF: $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Standardization</h3>
            <p>Any normal variable can be converted to a <strong>standard normal</strong> $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$:</p>
            <p>$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$</p>
            <p>The standard normal CDF is $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\leq z)$.</p>
            <h3>Using Symmetry</h3>
            <p>Since the standard normal is symmetric around zero: $P(Z > -z) = P(Z &lt; z) = \\Phi(z)$</p>
            <h3>Linear Transformations Preserve Normality</h3>
            <p>If $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, then $Y = a + bX \\sim N(a + b\\mu,\ b^2\\sigma^2)$. This property is important because OLS estimators are linear functions of the data — if $u$ is normally distributed, so are $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$.</p>
            <h3>Role in Hypothesis Testing</h3>
            <p>Under the classical OLS assumptions (SLR.1–SLR.5 plus normality of $u$), the $t$-statistic $t = \\hat{\\beta}_1 / se(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ follows a $t(n-2)$ distribution, allowing exact inference in small samples.</p>
