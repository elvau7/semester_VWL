    {id: 1, title: "Definitions of Income and Equivalence Scales", html: `
      <h2>Definitions of Income</h2>
      <p>Measuring income is complex because income is a <strong>flow</strong> that is typically measured over a specific period of time.</p>

      <h3>Simons (1938) Definition</h3>
      <p>Simons introduced a comprehensive and backward-looking definition of personal income. According to Simons, personal income is the sum of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the value of <strong>consumption</strong>, and</li>
        <li>the <strong>change in the value of the store of wealth</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A key implication of this definition is that <strong>capital gains are treated as income even when they have not yet been realized</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Hicks (1939) Definition</h3>
      <p>Hicks proposed a forward-looking and welfare-based concept of income. He defined income as the <strong>maximum amount a person can consume during a week and still expect to be as well-off at the end of the week as at the beginning</strong>.</p>
      <p>This approach focuses more strongly on welfare and expectations. Although uncertainty can be incorporated, <strong>unexpected gains are generally not treated as income</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Practical Relevance</h3>
      <p>In practice, the definitions of income that are used in tax systems rarely correspond exactly to either the Simons or the Hicks definition.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Equivalence Scales</h2>
      <p>Households differ in size and demographic composition, for example in the number of adults, the number of children, and the ages of household members.</p>
      <p>Because a larger household needs more income than a smaller household to achieve the same level of welfare, observed household income must be <strong>adjusted</strong> to make households comparable. This adjustment is made using <strong>equivalence scales</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Minimum Needs Scale</h3>
      <p>This approach is based on the cost of a <strong>basic bundle of goods and services</strong>, which differs depending on the household's demographic composition.</p>
      <p>For example, in the Rowntree scale, <strong>$60 for a single person is considered equivalent to $100 for a couple</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Engel Scale</h3>
      <p>The Engel scale is based on the hypothesis that the <strong>share of expenditure devoted to food</strong> reflects a household's welfare level.</p>
      <p>Two households are treated as having equivalent incomes if, despite demographic differences, they spend the <strong>same proportion of their budget on food</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Adult Good Scale</h3>
      <p>This method adjusts for the presence of children by focusing on goods that are consumed <strong>only by adults</strong>.</p>
      <p>Households are considered equivalent if their incomes generate the <strong>same level of demand for adult-specific goods</strong>.</p>

      <h3>General Approach</h3>
      <p>To overcome the limitations of the previous methods, a more general approach defines the equivalence scale as the <strong>minimum cost required to achieve a given utility level</strong> for a household with a particular demographic structure.</p>
      <p>This method assumes the existence of a formal <strong>household utility function</strong>, which can be used to derive equivalent budget lines for different household types.</p>

    {id: 2, title: "Inequality Measures", html: `
        <h2>Inequality</h2>
        <p>Inequality refers to an <strong>unequal distribution of income or wealth</strong> across a population.</p>
        <p>To quantify inequality, economists use <strong>inequality measures</strong>. These are single numbers that usually assign a value between <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong> to a given distribution, where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0</strong> indicates complete equality,</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> indicates complete inequality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Pigou-Dalton Principle</h3>
        <p>A fundamental requirement for any credible inequality measure is the <strong>Pigou-Dalton Principle of Transfers</strong>.</p>
        <p>This principle states that an inequality index must <strong>decrease</strong> if income is transferred from a richer household to a poorer household, as long as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>their relative rankings remain unchanged, and</li>
          <li>total income stays constant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Measures that do not satisfy this principle are generally seen as less suitable, because they are not sufficiently sensitive to redistributions within the income distribution.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Statistical Measures of Inequality</h2>

        <h3>The Range (R)</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Range</strong> is the simplest inequality measure. It is calculated as the difference between the <strong>highest</strong> and the <strong>lowest</strong> income, divided by the <strong>mean income</strong>.</p>
        <p>Its main weakness is that it ignores all incomes between the two extremes.</p>

        <h3>Relative Mean Deviation (D)</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Relative Mean Deviation</strong> takes all incomes into account.</p>
        <p>However, it is <strong>insensitive to transfers</strong> between households that are both on the same side of the mean income level, meaning it does not fully reflect some redistributions.</p>

        <h3>Coefficient of Variation (C)</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Coefficient of Variation</strong> satisfies the <strong>Pigou-Dalton Principle</strong>.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Range or the Relative Mean Deviation, it responds appropriately to redistributions from richer to poorer households.</p>
        <p>However, its effect depends only on the <strong>income difference</strong> between households. Some economists argue that transfers should have a larger effect when they occur at <strong>lower income levels</strong>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Lorenz Curve and the Gini Coefficient</h2>

        <h3>The Lorenz Curve</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Lorenz Curve</strong> is the most common graphical representation of inequality.</p>
        <p>It shows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the cumulative proportion of the <strong>population</strong> (ranked from poorest to richest), and</li>
          <li>the cumulative proportion of <strong>total income</strong> received by that population share.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In a perfectly equal society, the Lorenz Curve would coincide with the <strong>45-degree diagonal</strong>.</p>
        <p>The further the Lorenz Curve lies below this diagonal, the <strong>greater the degree of inequality</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The Gini Coefficient (G)</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Gini Coefficient</strong> is the most common numerical measure of inequality.</p>
        <p>Geometrically, it is defined as <strong>twice the area between the Lorenz Curve and the 45-degree diagonal</strong>.</p>
        <p>The Gini Coefficient:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>provides a complete ranking of distributions, and</li>
          <li>satisfies the <strong>Pigou-Dalton Principle</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, it is a <strong>linear</strong> measure. This means its response to a transfer depends only on the <strong>rank positions</strong> of the households involved, not on their absolute income levels.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Atkinson Measure</h2>
        <p>While statistical measures contain only <em>implicit</em> welfare assumptions, the <strong>Atkinson Measure</strong> makes welfare judgments <strong>explicit</strong> by starting from a <strong>social welfare function</strong>.</p>

        <h3>MEDE</h3>
        <p>The Atkinson approach uses the concept of <strong>Equally Distributed Equivalent Income (MEDE)</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is the level of income which, if received equally by everyone, would generate the <strong>same total utility</strong> as the actual unequal income distribution.</p>

        <h3>The Measure (A)</h3>
        <p>The Atkinson inequality measure is calculated as:</p>
        <p>$$A = 1 - \\frac{\\text{MEDE}}{\\bar{M}}$$</p>
        <p>where $\\bar{M}$ is mean income.</p>

        <h3>Parameter e</h3>
        <p>The parameter <strong>e</strong> reflects the degree of <strong>social concern for equity</strong>.</p>
        <p>As <strong>e</strong> increases, the utility function becomes more <strong>concave</strong>, which means that society gives relatively more weight to income transfers benefiting the <strong>very poor</strong>.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Market Inequality vs. Net Inequality</h2>
        <p>In applied research, especially in studies by the <strong>OECD</strong>, economists distinguish between:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>market inequality</strong> — inequality before taxes and transfers, and</li>
          <li><strong>net inequality</strong> — inequality after taxes and transfers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These studies show that tax and transfer systems are generally <strong>redistributive</strong>.</p>
        <p>At the same time, market inequality has increased over time in many countries.</p>
        <p>Researchers often control for <strong>age</strong>, for example by focusing on people <strong>under age 60</strong>, in order to avoid distortions caused by early retirement when analyzing labor market inequality.</p>

   {id: 3, title: "Poverty, Equality of Opportunity, and Intergenerational Mobility", html: `
      <h2>Poverty</h2>
      <p>Poverty is defined as the possession of <strong>fewer resources than necessary to attain an acceptable standard of living</strong>.</p>
      <p>Poverty must be distinguished from <strong>inequality</strong>. Inequality refers to the overall distribution of resources across the population, whereas poverty focuses specifically on the existence of <strong>very low incomes</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Concepts and Delineation of Poverty</h3>
      <p>To determine who is poor and who is not, economists use a <strong>poverty line</strong>, denoted by <strong>z</strong>.</p>
      <p>There are two main approaches to defining this poverty line:</p>

      <h3>Absolute Poverty</h3>
      <p><strong>Absolute poverty</strong> assumes that there is a fixed minimum level of consumption that defines poverty, regardless of time or place.</p>
      <p>An example is the <strong>United States</strong>, where the poverty line is based on a package of minimum needs.</p>

      <h3>Relative Poverty</h3>
      <p><strong>Relative poverty</strong> is defined in relation to the standards of a specific society and period of time.</p>
      <p>An example is the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, where the poverty line is defined as a proportion of the minimum benefit level.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Measuring Poverty</h2>
      <p>Economists use different poverty indices, ranging from simple counts to more comprehensive welfare-based measures.</p>

      <h3>Headcount Ratio (E)</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Headcount Ratio</strong> is the simplest poverty measure.</p>
      <p>It is calculated as the number of poor households or individuals <strong>q</strong> divided by the total population <strong>H</strong>.</p>
      <p>This measure is easy to compute, but it does <strong>not capture the depth of poverty</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Aggregate Poverty Gap (V)</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Aggregate Poverty Gap</strong> is the sum of all income shortfalls of those below the poverty line.</p>
      <p>For a poor household $h$, the poverty gap is:</p>
      <p>$$g_h = z - M_h$$</p>
      <p>This measure shows the <strong>total amount of income required to eliminate poverty</strong>.</p>
      <p>However, it does not account for the number of poor people or for transfers among the poor.</p>

      <h3>Income Gap Ratio (I)</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Income Gap Ratio</strong> measures the <strong>average shortfall</strong> of poor households relative to the poverty line.</p>
      <p>A weakness of this measure is that it can produce a paradoxical result: if one household is lifted out of poverty, the average poverty gap among the remaining poor may increase, making poverty appear worse even though one household has improved.</p>

      <h3>Sen Measure (S)</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Sen Measure</strong> is a more comprehensive poverty index.</p>
      <p>It combines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <strong>headcount ratio</strong>,</li>
        <li>the <strong>average income shortfall</strong>, and</li>
        <li>the <strong>Gini coefficient among the poor</strong> ($G_p$).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This measure is designed to satisfy important axioms and gives <strong>greater weight to the poorest households</strong>.</p>

      <h3>FGT Class ($P_\\alpha$)</h3>
      <p>The <strong>FGT class of poverty measures</strong> forms a family of indices that satisfy <strong>subgroup consistency</strong>.</p>
      <p>This means that overall poverty rises whenever poverty rises in any subgroup of the population.</p>
      <p>Depending on the value of the parameter $\\alpha$, the FGT measure takes different forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$\\alpha = 0$: the measure is the <strong>Headcount Ratio</strong>,</li>
        <li>$\\alpha = 1$: the measure combines the headcount and the poverty gap,</li>
        <li>$\\alpha > 1$: the measure becomes increasingly sensitive to the <strong>poorest households</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h2>Equality of Opportunity</h2>
      <p><strong>Equality of Opportunity</strong> is a non-welfarist policy concept that focuses not only on outcomes, but also on <strong>how those outcomes are generated</strong>.</p>
      <p>It distinguishes between two main sources of inequality:</p>

      <h3>Effort</h3>
      <p><strong>Effort</strong> includes factors for which individuals are personally responsible.</p>
      <p>If inequality arises from different levels of effort, it is generally argued that policy <strong>should not compensate</strong> for these differences.</p>

      <h3>Circumstances</h3>
      <p><strong>Circumstances</strong> include factors beyond individual control, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>family background,</li>
        <li>race,</li>
        <li>gender,</li>
        <li>place of birth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inequality arising from such circumstances <strong>should be compensated</strong> according to the equality of opportunity view. This idea provides an important justification for <strong>affirmative action</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Measurement</h3>
      <p>Equality of opportunity is formally measured using <strong>stochastic dominance</strong>.</p>
      <p>Equality of opportunity exists when no set of circumstances is preferred by all individuals.</p>
      <p>The standard criterion is <strong>first-order stochastic dominance</strong>:</p>
      <p>$$F(x \\mid s) \\leq F(x \\mid s')$$</p>
      <p>In addition, <strong>second-order stochastic dominance</strong> and <strong>Gini-type indices</strong> can also be used to detect inequality of opportunity.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Intergenerational Inequality and Mobility</h2>
      <p><strong>Social mobility</strong> occurs when children achieve a different social status from their parents.</p>
      <p>Formally, this means that there is no strong correlation between the <strong>education</strong> or <strong>earnings</strong> of parents and those of their children.</p>

      <h3>Measurement</h3>
      <p>Intergenerational mobility is measured using <strong>correlations</strong> and <strong>elasticities</strong>.</p>
      <p>An elasticity greater than <strong>1</strong> indicates that inequality is becoming stronger across generations.</p>

      <h3>Transition Matrices</h3>
      <p><strong>Transition matrices</strong> are used to estimate mobility at particular points of the income distribution.</p>
      <p>For example, in the United States, around <strong>40%</strong> of sons born to fathers in the lowest quintile remain in that same quintile.</p>

      <h3>Contributing Factors</h3>
      <p>Intergenerational mobility is influenced by both <strong>nature</strong> and <strong>nurture</strong>.</p>
      <p>Important contributing factors include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>education,</li>
        <li>credit constraints,</li>
        <li>social segregation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These factors can reinforce attitudes and structures that help sustain inequality over time.</p>

    {id: 4, title: "Rent-Seeking", html: `
    <h2>Rent-Seeking</h2>
    <p><strong>Rent-seeking</strong>, also called <strong>privilege-seeking</strong>, refers to the <strong>unproductive activity of attempting to capture an existing income flow rather than creating a new one</strong>.</p>
    <p>This distinguishes rent-seeking from <strong>profit-seeking</strong>. In the ideal case, profit-seeking is socially beneficial because it creates new opportunities and generates <strong>innovation rents</strong>. By contrast, rent-seeking uses resources to create or preserve profitable opportunities that are <strong>socially harmful</strong>, for example by hiring lawyers or lobbyists to block substitute imports in order to protect a monopoly position.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Rent-Seeking Games</h2>
    <p>Rent-seeking games analyze how many resources will be wasted in the attempt to win a specific <strong>prize</strong> or <strong>rent</strong>, denoted by <strong>V</strong>.</p>
    <p>The resources spent in these games, such as lobbying expenditures or legal fees, are effectively <strong>burnt</strong>. They represent a <strong>net loss to society</strong> because they do not create additional output.</p>

    <h3>The Deterministic Game</h3>
    <p>In the <strong>deterministic game</strong>, there is no uncertainty. A marginally higher bid always guarantees victory.</p>

    <h3>Equilibrium</h3>
    <p>There is <strong>no pure-strategy equilibrium</strong> in this setting, because each competitor always has an incentive to bid slightly more than the rival in order to secure the entire prize.</p>
    <p>Instead, the equilibrium is in <strong>mixed strategies</strong>, where players choose bids according to a probability distribution with density $\\frac{1}{V}$.</p>

    <h3>Complete Dissipation Theorem</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Complete Dissipation Theorem</strong> states that if there are <strong>two or more competitors</strong> in a deterministic rent-seeking game, the <strong>total expected resources expended are exactly equal to the value of the prize $V$</strong>.</p>
    <p>As a result, the existence of the prize yields <strong>no net social benefit</strong>, because its entire value is dissipated in the rent-seeking process.</p>

    <h3>The Probabilistic Game</h3>
    <p>In the <strong>probabilistic game</strong>, a higher bid increases the probability of winning, but it does <strong>not guarantee success</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Logic of the Model</h3>
    <p>The usual assumption is that an individual's probability of winning is equal to that individual's <strong>share of total rent-seeking expenditure</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Partial Dissipation Theorem</h3>
    <p>In a probabilistic game with $n$ competitors, the <strong>total expected resources expended</strong> equal the fraction:</p>
    <p>$$\\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdot V$$</p>
    <p>This means that full dissipation does not occur, but the total waste increases as the number of competitors grows.</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>Although society does not lose the full value of the prize when the number of competitors is finite, the fraction of the prize wasted becomes larger as $n$ increases and tends toward <strong>1</strong>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Social and Economic Consequences</h2>

    <h3>Monopoly Cost</h3>
    <p>Rent-seeking theory changes the assessment of the <strong>social cost of monopoly</strong>.</p>
    <p>In standard economic analysis, the cost of monopoly is usually limited to the <strong>deadweight loss</strong>, denoted by <strong>d</strong>.</p>
    <p>Rent-seeking analysis argues that the true social cost is much larger:</p>
    <p>$$\\pi + d$$</p>
    <p>Here, $\\pi$ represents monopoly profits, which may be fully dissipated by competitors trying to secure or defend the monopoly position.</p>

    <h3>Resource Misallocation</h3>
    <p>Rent-seeking leads to <strong>resource misallocation</strong> because it shifts resources away from productive uses and toward unproductive activities such as lobbying, legal protection, and privilege-seeking.</p>

    <h3>Reduction in Potential Output</h3>
    <p>By diverting labor and other resources away from production, rent-seeking reduces the economy's <strong>potential output</strong>.</p>
    <p>In terms of production theory, the <strong>production possibility frontier (PPF)</strong> shifts inward.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Informative Lobbying</h2>
    <p><strong>Lobbying</strong> is a major form of rent-seeking. It can make a positive contribution only if lobbyists are <strong>better informed than the policy-maker</strong> and are able to provide <strong>credible information</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Credibility Condition</h3>
    <p>A policy-maker will accept a lobbyist's report as honest only if the divergence in preferences between the two is sufficiently small.</p>
    <p>Let $\\Delta$ denote this preference divergence. In a two-state model, the condition for an honest report is:</p>
    <p>$$\\Delta \\leq \\frac{q_h - q_l}{2}$$</p>
    <p>If this condition is satisfied, truthful communication is possible.</p>

    <h3>Failure of Honest Reporting</h3>
    <p>If this condition is <strong>not</strong> satisfied, the lobbyist has a rational incentive to <strong>misreport</strong> information.</p>
    <p>In that case, the policy-maker will ignore the report and choose a policy that is likely to be <strong>incorrect in both possible states of the world</strong>.</p>
`},
    {id: 5, title: "Informative Lobbying", html: `
      <h2>Informative Lobbying</h2>
      <p><strong>Informative lobbying</strong> occurs when a lobbyist, who is better informed about the future state of the world than the policy-maker, communicates <strong>credible information</strong> that improves policy decisions.</p>
      <p>Although lobbying is often seen as an <strong>unproductive rent-seeking activity</strong>, it can make a positive contribution if it helps solve the problem of <strong>information transmission</strong>.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Conflict of Interest</h2>
      <p>The central difficulty of informative lobbying is that the <strong>preferences of the lobbyist and the policy-maker are not usually identical</strong>.</p>
      <p>In economic models, this disagreement is represented by the parameter $\\Delta$, which measures the <strong>divergence of preferences</strong>.</p>

      <h3>The Policy-Maker</h3>
      <p>The <strong>policy-maker</strong> wants to choose a policy, denoted by <strong>p</strong> or $\\pi$, that matches the true state of the world, denoted by <strong>q</strong> or $\\theta$.</p>
      <p>The objective is to maximize <strong>social welfare</strong> by selecting the policy that is appropriate for the actual state.</p>

      <h3>The Lobbyist</h3>
      <p>The <strong>lobbyist</strong> knows the true state of the world, but does not share the same objective as the policy-maker.</p>
      <p>Instead, the lobbyist prefers a policy shifted in their own favor, namely $q + \\Delta$.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Condition for Credibility</h2>
      <p>A policy-maker will only rely on a lobbyist's message if that message is <strong>credible</strong>.</p>
      <p>In the basic model, there are two possible states of the world:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <strong>low state</strong> $q_l$, and</li>
        <li>a <strong>high state</strong> $q_h$.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The problem is that the lobbyist may have an incentive to report the <strong>high state</strong> even when the true state is low, because this can induce the policy-maker to choose a higher policy level.</p>

      <h3>Truthful Reporting</h3>
      <p>Lobbying is informative only if the lobbyist has <strong>no rational incentive to lie</strong>.</p>
      <p>In the two-state model, truthful reporting can be sustained only if:</p>
      <p>$$\\Delta \\leq \\frac{q_h - q_l}{2}$$</p>
      <p>This means that the disagreement between the lobbyist and the policy-maker must be sufficiently small.</p>
      <p>More precisely, the preference divergence $\\Delta$ must be less than or equal to <strong>half the distance between the two states</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Failure of Credibility</h3>
      <p>If $\\Delta$ is too large, the lobbyist will always prefer to report the <strong>high state</strong>, regardless of the truth.</p>
      <p>Once the policy-maker understands this, the report loses credibility and is ignored.</p>
      <p>The policy-maker then chooses a <strong>default policy</strong>, which is likely to be incorrect in both possible states of the world.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Many States and Partial Revelation</h2>
      <p>When the number of possible states increases, the differences between neighboring states, such as $q_{i+1} - q_i$, become smaller.</p>
      <p>This makes credible communication more difficult, because even a small preference divergence $\\Delta$ may become too large relative to the distance between states.</p>

      <h3>Partial Revelation</h3>
      <p>To address this problem, models of informative lobbying often rely on <strong>partial revelation</strong> instead of full revelation.</p>

      <h3>Partitioning</h3>
      <p>The possible states are grouped into broader <strong>partitions</strong>, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <strong>Low</strong> group (<strong>L</strong>), and</li>
        <li>a <strong>High</strong> group (<strong>H</strong>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Group Reporting</h3>
      <p>The lobbyist does not report the exact state, but only indicates <strong>which partition</strong> the true state belongs to.</p>
      <p>This reduces the temptation to misreport, because the communicated information is less precise.</p>

      <h3>Honesty Range</h3>
      <p>The lobbyist reports the partition honestly only if $\\Delta$ lies within a certain interval:</p>
      <p>$$\\frac{q_{i+1} - p(H) - p(L)}{2} \\leq \\Delta \\leq \\frac{q_i - p(H) - p(L)}{2}$$</p>
      <p>Here, $p(L)$ and $p(H)$ are the policies chosen by the policy-maker after receiving a low or high report.</p>
      <p>Even under partial revelation, credible information transmission is possible only when the divergence of preferences remains sufficiently limited.</p>

      <p>A <strong>club good</strong> is a type of <strong>impure public good</strong> that is either <strong>nonrivalrous</strong> or only <strong>partly rivalrous</strong>, but for which <strong>exclusion</strong> of non-members is possible.</p>
      <p>This distinguishes club goods from <strong>pure public goods</strong>, where providers cannot prevent individuals from consuming the good.</p>
      <p>In the case of club goods, access can be restricted either through <strong>literal exclusion</strong>, such as membership checks, or through <strong>legal exclusion</strong>, such as formal entitlement rules.</p>
      <p>Typical examples include <strong>sports clubs</strong>, <strong>shared facilities</strong>, and international organizations such as <strong>NATO</strong>.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Preference Revelation</h2>
      <p>A special feature of club goods is that the problem of <strong>preference revelation</strong> is largely absent.</p>
      <p>Because individuals must actively decide whether to <strong>join the club</strong> and pay a <strong>membership fee</strong>, their decision reveals their willingness to pay for the good provided.</p>
      <p>The collection of membership fees also ensures that the club can, in principle, <strong>break even financially</strong>.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Fundamental Trade-off</h2>
      <p>According to the <strong>Buchanan Model (1965)</strong>, internal efficiency in a club is achieved by balancing two opposing effects.</p>

      <h3>Cost Sharing</h3>
      <p>When more members are admitted, existing members benefit because the <strong>total cost of providing the good is shared among more people</strong>.</p>
      <p>This lowers the <strong>individual fee</strong> or cost burden for each member.</p>

      <h3>Congestion</h3>
      <p>At the same time, adding more members can reduce utility because it leads to <strong>congestion</strong>.</p>
      <p>Congestion means that the club good or facility becomes <strong>overcrowded</strong> or <strong>over-utilized</strong>, which lowers the benefit each member receives.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Optimization Conditions</h2>
      <p>Efficiency in a <strong>single-product club</strong> is achieved when two conditions are satisfied.</p>

      <h3>Optimal Provision</h3>
      <p>The first condition is a variant of the <strong>Samuelson condition</strong>.</p>
      <p>The sum of the <strong>marginal rates of substitution</strong> of all club members must equal the <strong>marginal cost</strong> of providing the good:</p>
      <p>$$n \\times MRS = MC$$</p>
      <p>This determines the <strong>optimal quantity of the club good</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Optimal Membership</h3>
      <p>The second condition determines the <strong>optimal number of members</strong>.</p>
      <p>Efficiency requires that the <strong>marginal utility cost of an additional member</strong>—that is, the utility loss caused by congestion—must be exactly equal to the <strong>benefit from improved cost sharing</strong>.</p>
      <p>This condition can be written as:</p>
      <p>$$MRS_{n,x} = -\\frac{C(G)}{n^2}$$</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Economy-wide Efficiency</h2>
      <p>Even if individual clubs are internally efficient, this does <strong>not automatically guarantee efficiency for the economy as a whole</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Small Clubs</h3>
      <p>If the <strong>optimal club size is small</strong> relative to the total population, the economy will tend toward efficiency as the number of optimally sized clubs increases.</p>
      <p>In the limit, the population can be divided into many clubs operating close to their efficient size.</p>

      <h3>Large Clubs</h3>
      <p>If the <strong>optimal membership size is large</strong> relative to the total population, an <strong>integer problem</strong> arises.</p>
      <p>In this case, it is impossible to divide the population into a set of clubs that all have the exact efficient size.</p>
      <p>As a result, some individuals may be <strong>excluded</strong>, or some clubs may have to operate with <strong>inefficient membership levels</strong>.</p>
`},
   {id: 7, title: "Local Public Goods and the Tiebout Hypothesis", html: `
      <h2>Local Public Goods</h2>
      <p><strong>Local public goods</strong> are a specific type of <strong>impure public good</strong> that are defined mainly by <strong>geographic restriction</strong>.</p>
      <p>They provide benefits only to individuals living within a particular <strong>area</strong> or <strong>locality</strong>.</p>
      <p>Unlike pure public goods, where exclusion is often impossible, exclusion from a local public good is usually a matter of <strong>policy</strong>.</p>
      <p>For example, local governments may use <strong>residency requirements</strong> or <strong>immigration controls</strong> to restrict access.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Dynamics of Local Public Goods</h2>
      <p>The provision of local public goods involves a basic economic trade-off related to <strong>population size</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Cost Sharing</h3>
      <p>As the population of a locality increases, the <strong>cost per resident</strong> of financing the public good falls.</p>
      <p>This is because the total cost of provision, denoted by <strong>G</strong>, is divided among a larger number of residents, denoted by <strong>h</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Congestion</h3>
      <p>At the same time, a larger population can create <strong>congestion</strong>.</p>
      <p>Congestion means crowding or the dilution of fixed local resources, which reduces the <strong>utility of individual residents</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Efficiency Rule</h3>
      <p>A locality achieves optimal provision when it satisfies a local variant of the <strong>Samuelson rule</strong>.</p>
      <p>This condition requires that the sum of the marginal rates of substitution equals <strong>1</strong>:</p>
      <p>$$h \\cdot \\frac{U_G}{U_x} = 1$$</p>

      <h3>Free Location Choice</h3>
      <p>In a system without enforced exclusion, individuals can move freely between jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>Population will then redistribute itself until an equilibrium is reached in which <strong>no consumer has an incentive to move</strong>.</p>
      <p>However, free mobility alone does <strong>not guarantee efficiency</strong>, because the movement of one individual affects the welfare of both the locality they leave and the locality they join.</p>
      <p>These effects are examples of <strong>non-market linkages</strong>.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Tiebout Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Tiebout Hypothesis</strong>, developed by <strong>Charles Tiebout in 1956</strong>, argues that the usual inefficiencies associated with public goods, especially the <strong>free-rider problem</strong>, do not necessarily apply at the local level.</p>

      <h3>Core Mechanism: Voting with Feet</h3>
      <p>The central idea is that if there are enough communities offering different combinations of <strong>taxes</strong> and <strong>public goods</strong>, consumers will behave like <strong>competitive buyers</strong> in a private market.</p>
      <p>By choosing to live in the community that best matches their preferences, consumers effectively <strong>vote with their feet</strong>.</p>
      <p>This process replaces the normal market test of willingness to pay and forces individuals to reveal their preferences through their <strong>location choice</strong>.</p>
      <p>As a result, the information problem that usually complicates the provision of national public goods may be reduced at the local level.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The Seven Assumptions for Efficiency</h2>
      <p>For the Tiebout model to generate a market-like efficient outcome, seven strong assumptions are required.</p>

      <h3>1. Full Mobility</h3>
      <p>Consumer-voters are completely free to move to the community that best satisfies their preferences.</p>

      <h3>2. Full Knowledge</h3>
      <p>Consumers possess perfect information about the <strong>revenue</strong> and <strong>expenditure patterns</strong> of all communities.</p>

      <h3>3. Large Number of Communities</h3>
      <p>There must be many communities so that individuals have a wide range of options to choose from.</p>

      <h3>4. No Employment Restrictions</h3>
      <p>Location decisions must not be determined by employment.</p>
      <p>This requires either that income comes from <strong>rents or dividends</strong>, or that employment opportunities are identical across communities.</p>

      <h3>5. No Externalities</h3>
      <p>Public services provided by one community must not create benefits or costs for neighboring communities.</p>

      <h3>6. Optimal Community Size</h3>
      <p>For every bundle of public services, there is an <strong>optimal population size</strong> at which average cost is minimized.</p>

      <h3>7. Community Adaptation</h3>
      <p>Communities below their optimal size try to attract new residents in order to reduce average costs.</p>
      <p>Communities above the optimum attempt to limit further growth, for example through <strong>zoning laws</strong>, or try to reduce population.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Limitations and Empirical Evidence</h2>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>The Tiebout Hypothesis has important limitations in practice.</p>
      <p>Real-world mobility is constrained by factors such as <strong>housing market frictions</strong> and the fact that many people are tied to a location because of their <strong>employment</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Tax Capitalization</h3>
      <p>An important empirical study by <strong>Oates (1969)</strong> found that house prices in New Jersey were higher in communities that provided more local public goods.</p>
      <p>This suggests that the benefits of local public services are <strong>capitalized into property values</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Preference Sorting</h3>
      <p><strong>Gramlich and Rubinfeld (1982)</strong> found evidence from Michigan suburbs that residents sort themselves according to their preferences.</p>
      <p>Variation in demand within a given location was much smaller than variation across locations, which supports the idea of <strong>preference sorting</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Overall Assessment</h3>
      <p>Tiebout's argument is ultimately that, although the model is highly abstract, local government may represent a part of the public sector in which the allocation of public goods can reflect individual preferences <strong>almost as effectively as private markets</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Gini Coefficient: Exact Formula</h2>
    <p>With $H$ households with incomes ordered $M_1 \\leq M_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq M_H$ and mean $\\bar{M}$:</p>
    <p>$$G = 1 - \\frac{1}{H^2 \\bar{M}} \\sum_i \\sum_j \\min\{M_i, M_j\}$$</p>
    <p>Alternative (counting appearances of each income level):</p>
    <p>$$G = 1 - \\frac{1}{H^2 \\bar{M}} \\cdot \\left([2H-1]M_1 + [2H-3]M_2 + \\ldots + M_H\\right)$$</p>
    <h3>Geometric interpretation</h3>
    <p>$G$ = twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the 45° diagonal.</p>
    <h3>Response to a transfer</h3>
    <p>If an amount $\\Gamma$ is transferred from household $i$ (poorer) to $j$ (richer) with $i < j$:</p>
    <p>$$\\Delta G = \\frac{2}{H^2 \\bar{M}} \\cdot (j - i) \\cdot \\Gamma > 0$$</p>
    <p>The change depends only on the <strong>rank difference</strong> $(j - i)$, not on absolute income levels. This is why the Gini is called "linear."</p>
    <h3>Atkinson's Theorem (14.2)</h3>
    <p>If two distributions have the same mean and their Lorenz curves do not cross, then every symmetric and concave welfare function $W = W(M_1, \\ldots, M_H)$ assigns higher welfare to the distribution with the Lorenz curve closest to the diagonal.</p>
    <p><em>Implication:</em> When Lorenz curves cross, we cannot rank distributions without additional welfare assumptions.</p>

  {id: 9, title: "Atkinson Measure: Formal Derivation", html: `
    <h2>Atkinson Measure: Formal Setup</h2>
    <p>Start from a utilitarian welfare function:</p>
    <p>$$W = \\sum_h U(M_h)$$ where $U'(M) > 0$ and $U''(M) < 0$ (concave)</p>
    <h3>MEDE (Equally Distributed Equivalent Income)</h3>
    <p>Define $M^{EDE}$ by: $\\sum_h U(M_h) = H \\cdot U(M^{EDE})$</p>
    <p>$M^{EDE}$ is the income level which, if received equally by all, gives the same total welfare as the actual distribution. Since $U$ is concave: $M^{EDE} < \\bar{M}$.</p>
    <h3>Atkinson inequality measure</h3>
    <p>$$A = 1 - \\frac{M^{EDE}}{\\bar{M}}$$</p>
    <p>$A \\in [0,1]$. $A = 0$ means perfect equality; $A = 1$ means all income held by one person.</p>
    <h3>Parameterization</h3>
    <p>The standard functional form is:</p>
    <p>$$U(M) = \\frac{M^{1-e}}{1-e} \\text{ for } e \\neq 1; \\quad U(M) = \\log(M) \\text{ for } e = 1$$</p>
    <p>The parameter $e \\geq 0$ captures social concern for equity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$e = 0$: no concern for distribution ($A = 0$ always)</li>
      <li>$e = 1$: logarithmic utility; moderate equity concern</li>
      <li>$e \\to \\infty$: extreme Rawlsian concern — only the welfare of the poorest matters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Higher $e \\Rightarrow$ more concave utility $\\Rightarrow$ transfers to the poor have larger welfare effects $\\Rightarrow$ higher $A$ for the same distribution.</p>

    <h2>Deterministic Rent-Seeking Game: Derivation</h2>
    <p>Prize $= V$. Two competitors burn money; highest amount burned wins.</p>
    <h3>No pure-strategy equilibrium</h3>
    <p>If player 1 burns $B^*$, player 2 burns $B^* + \\varepsilon$ and wins $V$. This is profitable for any $B^* < V$. But $B = V$ gives $EP = \\frac{1}{2}V - V = -\\frac{1}{2}V < 0$. So no pure-strategy equilibrium exists.</p>
    <h3>Mixed-strategy equilibrium</h3>
    <p>The equilibrium strategy is to draw each burn amount from a uniform distribution over $[0, V]$:</p>
    <p>$$f(B) = \\frac{1}{V} \\text{ (density)}, \\quad F(B) = \\frac{B}{V} \\text{ (CDF)}$$</p>
    <p>Verification: if opponent uses $f(B) = \\frac{1}{V}$, burning $B$ gives:</p>
    <p>$$EP = F(B) \\cdot V - B = \\frac{B}{V} \\cdot V - B = B - B = 0$$</p>
    <p>Each player is indifferent over all amounts — confirming this is an equilibrium.</p>
    <h3>Total dissipation</h3>
    <p>Expected burn per player $= \\int_0^V B \\cdot \\frac{1}{V} \, dB = \\frac{V}{2}$. For two players: <strong>total $= V$</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Symmetric equilibrium</h3>
    <p>In the symmetric Nash equilibrium, $B_i = B^*$ for all $i$, so $B_{-i} = (n-1)B^*$:</p>

    <h2>Tariff Lobbying Model</h2>
    <p>Small open economy; domestic firm lobbies for tariff $t$ on imports.</p>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>Cost function: $C(y_1) = \\frac{y_1^2}{2}$. World price $= 1$, so price with tariff $= 1 + t$.</p>
    <p>Profit-maximizing output: $y_1(t) = 1 + t$ (since $MC = y_1 = \\text{price}$).</p>
    <h3>Profit</h3>
    <p>$$\\pi_1(t) = (1+t)y_1 - C(y_1) = (1+t)^2 - \\frac{(1+t)^2}{2} = \\frac{(1+t)^2}{2}$$</p>
    <h3>Rent from tariff</h3>
    <p>The additional profit from the tariff (versus $t=0$):</p>
    <p>$$\\pi_1(t) - \\pi_1(0) = \\frac{(1+t)^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2t + t^2}{2}$$</p>
    <h3>Complete dissipation of tariff rent</h3>
    <p>By the Complete Dissipation Theorem, resources spent lobbying for the tariff $= \\frac{2t+t^2}{2}$.</p>
    <p>These resources are withdrawn from other productive activities at a faster rate than the output gain $y_1(t) = 1+t$. Total output therefore falls at the rate of $t^2$ (the tariff squared).</p>
